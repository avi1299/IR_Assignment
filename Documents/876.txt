Motor neuron disease

A motor neuron disease, also spelled motor neurone disease (MND) is any of several neurological disorders that selectively affect motor neurons, the cells that control voluntary muscles of the body. They include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), primary lateral sclerosis, progressive muscular atrophy, progressive bulbar palsy, pseudobulbar palsy, and spinal muscular atrophy. They are neurodegenerative in nature and cause increasing disability and eventually, death.

Technically the term "motor neuron disease" includes several diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), primary lateral sclerosis, progressive muscular atrophy, progressive bulbar palsy, pseudobulbar palsy, and spinal muscular atrophy. 

In the United States the term is often used interchangeably with ALS. In the United Kingdom it is spelled "motor neurone disease" (MND) and is the usual term for ALS, and is sometimes used for the group of motor neuron diseases.

While MND refers to a specific subset of similar diseases, there are numerous other diseases of motor neurons that are referred to collectively as "motor neuron disorders", for instance disease belonging to spinal muscular atrophies. However, they are not classified as "motor neuron diseases" by the tenth International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10), which is the definition followed in this article.

Motor neuron diseases affect either upper motor neurons (UMN) or lower motor neurons (LMN), or both:
