Kim Renard Nazel (born June 17, 1965), better known by the stage name Arabian Prince, is an American singer-songwriter, rapper and producer.

Arabian Prince started working with Bobby Jimmy & the Critters in 1984. He also produced the hit single and album for J.J. Fad, "Supersonic".

In 1986, he was a founding member of N.W.A but when fellow member Ice Cube came back from the Phoenix Institute of Technology in 1988, Arabian Prince found himself to be surplus to the groupâ€”Eazy-E, Ice Cube and MC Ren were the main performers, DJ Yella was the turntablist and Dr. Dre was the main producer.

After leaving N.W.A, Arabian Prince began a solo career. His first album, "Brother Arab", was released in 1989; "[[Where's My Bytches]" followed in 1993.

In the mid-2000s, he started releasing music again, with his Professor X project on the Dutch label Clone Records. In 2007 he performed as a DJ on the 2K Sports Holiday Bounce Tour with artists from the [[Stones Throw]] label. In 2008, Stones Throw released a compilation of his electro-rap material from the 1980s. One of his songs was included on the 2007 video game, "[[College Hoops 2K8]]".
