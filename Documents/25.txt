autism

autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction  verbal and non verbal communication  and restricted and repetitive behavior  parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child s life  these signs often develop gradually  though some children with autism reach their developmental milestones at a normal pace and then regress  the diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent in early childhood  typically before age three 
while autism is highly heritable  researchers suspect both environmental and genetic factors as causes  in rare cases  autism is strongly associated with agents that cause birth defects  controversies surround other proposed environmental causes  for example  the vaccine hypotheses  which have since been disproven  autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize  how this occurs is not well understood  in the dsm v it is one of three recognized disorders in the autism spectrum  asds   the other two being asperger syndrome  which lacks delays in cognitive development and language  and pervasive developmental disorder  not otherwise specified  commonly abbreviated as pdd nos   which is diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or asperger syndrome are not met 
early speech or behavioral interventions can help children with autism gain self care  social  and communication skills  although there is no known cure  there have been reported cases of children who recovered  not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood  though some become successful  an autistic culture has developed  with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder 
globally  autism is estimated to affect 21 7 million people as of 2013  as of 2010  the number of people affected is estimated at about 1–2 per 1 000 worldwide  it occurs four to five times more often in boys than girls  about 1 5  of children in the united states  one in 68  are diagnosed with asd   a 30  increase from one in 88 in 2012  the rate of autism among adults aged 18 years and over in the united kingdom is 1 1   the number of people diagnosed has been increasing dramatically since the 1980s  partly due to changes in diagnostic practice and government subsidized financial incentives for named diagnoses  the question of whether actual rates have increased is unresolved 

autism is a highly variable neurodevelopmental disorder that first appears during infancy or childhood  and generally follows a steady course without remission  people with autism may be severely impaired in some respects but normal  or even superior  in others  overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months  become established by age two or three years  and tend to continue through adulthood  although often in more muted form  it is distinguished not by a single symptom  but by a characteristic triad of symptoms  impairments in social interaction  impairments in communication  and restricted interests and repetitive behavior  other aspects  such as atypical eating  are also common but are not essential for diagnosis  autism s individual symptoms occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly  without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits 

social deficits distinguish autism and the related autism spectrum disorders  asd  see classification  from other developmental disorders  people with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted  noted autistic temple grandin described her inability to understand the social communication of neurotypicals  or people with normal neural development  as leaving her feeling  like an anthropologist on mars  

unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood  autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli  smile and look at others less often  and respond less to their own name  autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms  for example  they have less eye contact and turn taking  and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves  such as pointing at things  three  to five year old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding  approach others spontaneously  imitate and respond to emotions  communicate nonverbally  and take turns with others  however  they do form attachments to their primary caregivers  most children with autism display moderately less attachment security than neurotypical children  although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe asd  older children and adults with asd perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition although this may be partly due to a lower ability to define a person s own emotions 

children with high functioning autism suffer from more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non autistic peers  despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone  making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism  for them  the quality of friendships  not the number of friends  predicts how lonely they feel  functional friendships  such as those resulting in invitations to parties  may affect the quality of life more deeply 

there are many anecdotal reports  but few systematic studies  of aggression and violence in individuals with asd  the limited data suggest that  in children with intellectual disability  autism is associated with aggression  destruction of property  and tantrums 

about a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs  differences in communication may be present from the first year of life  and may include delayed onset of babbling  unusual gestures  diminished responsiveness  and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver  in the second and third years  children with autism have less frequent and less diverse babbling  consonants  words  and word combinations  their gestures are less often integrated with words  children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences  and are more likely to simply repeat others  words  echolalia  or reverse pronouns  joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech  and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with asd  for example  they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed at object  and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience  children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language 

in a pair of studies  high functioning children with autism aged 8–15 performed equally well as  and adults better than  individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling  both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language  comprehension and inference  as people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills  these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends 

autistic individuals display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior  which the repetitive behavior scale revised  rbs r  categorizes as follows 
no single repetitive or self injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism  but autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors 

autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis  but that can affect the individual or the family 
an estimated 0 5  to 10  of individuals with asd show unusual abilities  ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants  many individuals with asd show superior skills in perception and attention  relative to the general population  sensory abnormalities are found in over 90  of those with autism  and are considered core features by some  although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders  differences are greater for under responsivity  for example  walking into things  than for over responsivity  for example  distress from loud noises  or for sensation seeking  for example  rhythmic movements   an estimated 60 –80  of autistic people have motor signs that include poor muscle tone  poor motor planning  and toe walking  deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across asd and are greater in autism proper 

unusual eating behavior occurs in about three quarters of children with asd  to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator  selectivity is the most common problem  although eating rituals and food refusal also occur  this does not appear to result in malnutrition  although some children with autism also have gastrointestinal symptoms  there is a lack of published rigorous data to support the theory that children with autism have more or different gastrointestinal symptoms than usual  studies report conflicting results  and the relationship between gastrointestinal problems and asd is unclear 

parents of children with asd have higher levels of stress  siblings of children with asd report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings of children with down syndrome in these aspects of the sibling relationship  however  they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with down syndrome  siblings of individuals with asd have greater risk of negative well being and poorer sibling relationships as adults 

it has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic  cognitive  and neural levels for autism s characteristic triad of symptoms  however  there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co occur 
autism has a strong genetic basis  although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether asd is explained more by rare mutations with major effects  or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants  complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes  the environment  and epigenetic factors which do not change dna sequencing but are heritable and influence gene expression  many genes have been associated with autism through sequencing the genomes of affected individuals and their parents 

studies of twins suggest that heritability is 0 7 for autism and as high as 0 9 for asd  and siblings of those with autism are about 25 times more likely to be autistic than the general population  however  most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified  typically  autism cannot be traced to a mendelian  single gene  mutation or to a single chromosome abnormality  and none of the genetic syndromes associated with asds have been shown to selectively cause asd  numerous candidate genes have been located  with only small effects attributable to any particular gene  most loci individually explain less than 1  of cases of autism  the large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family members may result from spontaneous structural variation — such as deletions  duplications or inversions in genetic material during meiosis  hence  a substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited  that is  the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome 

several lines of evidence point to synaptic dysfunction as a cause of autism  some rare mutations may lead to autism by disrupting some synaptic pathways  such as those involved with cell adhesion  gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in synapses and on activity dependent changes  all known teratogens  agents that cause birth defects  related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from conception  and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later  there is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development 

exposure to air pollution during pregnancy  especially heavy metals and particulates  may increase the risk of autism  environmental factors that have been claimed without evidence to contribute to or exacerbate autism include certain foods  infectious diseases  solvents  diesel exhaust  pcbs  phthalates and phenols used in plastic products  pesticides  brominated flame retardants  alcohol  smoking  illicit drugs  vaccines  and prenatal stress  no evidence has been found for these claims  and some such as the mmr vaccine have been completely disproven 

parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination  this has led to unsupported theories blaming vaccine  overload   a vaccine preservative  or the mmr vaccine for causing autism  the latter theory was supported by a litigation funded study that has since been shown to have been  an elaborate fraud   although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible  parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of childhood immunizations  outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases in some countries  and the preventable deaths of several children 

autism s symptoms result from maturation related changes in various systems of the brain  how autism occurs is not well understood  its mechanism can be divided into two areas  the pathophysiology of brain structures and processes associated with autism  and the neuropsychological linkages between brain structures and behaviors  the behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiologies 

unlike many other brain disorders  such as parkinson s  autism does not have a clear unifying mechanism at either the molecular  cellular  or systems level  it is not known whether autism is a few disorders caused by mutations converging on a few common molecular pathways  or is  like intellectual disability  a large set of disorders with diverse mechanisms  autism appears to result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems  and to disturb the timing of brain development more than the final product  neuroanatomical studies and the associations with teratogens strongly suggest that autism s mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception  this anomaly appears to start a cascade of pathological events in the brain that are significantly influenced by environmental factors  just after birth  the brains of children with autism tend to grow faster than usual  followed by normal or relatively slower growth in childhood  it is not known whether early overgrowth occurs in all children with autism  it seems to be most prominent in brain areas underlying the development of higher cognitive specialization  hypotheses for the cellular and molecular bases of pathological early overgrowth include the following 

the immune system is thought to play an important role in autism  children with autism have been found by researchers to have inflammation of both the peripheral and central immune systems as indicated by increased levels of pro inflammatory cytokines and significant activation of microglia  biomarkers of abnormal immune function have also been associated with increased impairments in behaviors that are characteristic of the core features of autism such as deficits in social interactions and communication  interactions between the immune system and the nervous system begin early during the embryonic stage of life  and successful neurodevelopment depends on a balanced immune response  it is thought that activation of a pregnant mother s immune system such as from environmental toxicants or infection can contribute to causing autism through causing a disruption of brain development  this is supported by recent studies that have found that infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of autism 

the relationship of neurochemicals to autism is not well understood  several have been investigated  with the most evidence for the role of serotonin and of genetic differences in its transport  the role of group i metabotropic glutamate receptors  mglur  in the pathogenesis of fragile x syndrome  the most common identified genetic cause of autism  has led to interest in the possible implications for future autism research into this pathway  some data suggests neuronal overgrowth potentially related to an increase in several growth hormones or to impaired regulation of growth factor receptors  also  some inborn errors of metabolism are associated with autism  but probably account for less than 5  of cases 

the mirror neuron system  mns  theory of autism hypothesizes that distortion in the development of the mns interferes with imitation and leads to autism s core features of social impairment and communication difficulties  the mns operates when an animal performs an action or observes another animal perform the same action  the mns may contribute to an individual s understanding of other people by enabling the modeling of their behavior via embodied simulation of their actions  intentions  and emotions  several studies have tested this hypothesis by demonstrating structural abnormalities in mns regions of individuals with asd  delay in the activation in the core circuit for imitation in individuals with asperger syndrome  and a correlation between reduced mns activity and severity of the syndrome in children with asd  however  individuals with autism also have abnormal brain activation in many circuits outside the mns and the mns theory does not explain the normal performance of children with autism on imitation tasks that involve a goal or object 
asd related patterns of low function and aberrant activation in the brain differ depending on whether the brain is doing social or nonsocial tasks 
in autism there is evidence for reduced functional connectivity of the default network  a large scale brain network involved in social and emotional processing  with intact connectivity of the task positive network  used in sustained attention and goal directed thinking  in people with autism the two networks are not negatively correlated in time  suggesting an imbalance in toggling between the two networks  possibly reflecting a disturbance of self referential thought 

the underconnectivity theory of autism hypothesizes that autism is marked by underfunctioning high level neural connections and synchronization  along with an excess of low level processes  evidence for this theory has been found in functional neuroimaging studies on autistic individuals and by a brainwave study that suggested that adults with asd have local overconnectivity in the cortex and weak functional connections between the frontal lobe and the rest of the cortex  other evidence suggests the underconnectivity is mainly within each hemisphere of the cortex and that autism is a disorder of the association cortex 

from studies based on event related potentials  transient changes to the brain s electrical activity in response to stimuli  there is considerable evidence for differences in autistic individuals with respect to attention  orientation to auditory and visual stimuli  novelty detection  language and face processing  and information storage  several studies have found a preference for nonsocial stimuli  for example  magnetoencephalography studies have found evidence in children with autism of delayed responses in the brain s processing of auditory signals 

in the genetic area  relations have been found between autism and schizophrenia based on duplications and deletions of chromosomes  research showed that schizophrenia and autism are significantly more common in combination with 1q21 1 deletion syndrome  research on autism schizophrenia relations for chromosome 15  15q13 3   chromosome 16  16p13 1  and chromosome 17  17p12  are inconclusive 

functional connectivity studies have found both hypo  and hyper connectivity in brains of people with autism  hypo connectivity seems to dominate  especially for interhemispheric and cortico cortical functional connectivity 

two major categories of cognitive theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behavior 

the first category focuses on deficits in social cognition  simon baron cohen s empathizing–systemizing theory postulates that autistic individuals can systemize—that is  they can develop internal rules of operation to handle events inside the brain—but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents  an extension  the extreme male brain theory  hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain  defined psychometrically as individuals in whom systemizing is better than empathizing  these theories are somewhat related to baron cohen s earlier theory of mind approach  which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others  the theory of mind hypothesis is supported by the atypical responses of children with autism to the sally–anne test for reasoning about others  motivations  and the mirror neuron system theory of autism described in  pathophysiology  maps well to the hypothesis  however  most studies have found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals  ability to understand other people s basic intentions or goals  instead  data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others  viewpoints 

the second category focuses on nonsocial or general processing  the executive functions such as working memory  planning  inhibition  in his review  kenworthy states that  the claim of executive dysfunction as a causal factor in autism is controversial   however   it is clear that executive dysfunction plays a role in the social and cognitive deficits observed in individuals with autism   tests of core executive processes such as eye movement tasks indicate improvement from late childhood to adolescence  but performance never reaches typical adult levels  a strength of the theory is predicting stereotyped behavior and narrow interests  two weaknesses are that executive function is hard to measure and that executive function deficits have not been found in young children with autism 

weak central coherence theory hypothesizes that a limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in autism  one strength of this theory is predicting special talents and peaks in performance in autistic people  a related theory—enhanced perceptual functioning—focuses more on the superiority of locally oriented and perceptual operations in autistic individuals  these theories map well from the underconnectivity theory of autism 

neither category is satisfactory on its own  social cognition theories poorly address autism s rigid and repetitive behaviors  while the nonsocial theories have difficulty explaining social impairment and communication difficulties  a combined theory based on multiple deficits may prove to be more useful 

diagnosis is based on behavior  not cause or mechanism  under the dsm 5  autism is characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction across multiple contexts  as well as restricted  repetitive patterns of behavior  interests  or activities  these deficits are present in early childhood  typically before age three  and lead to clinically significant functional impairment  sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity  stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language  and persistent preoccupation with unusual objects  the disturbance must not be better accounted for by rett syndrome  intellectual disability or global developmental delay  icd 10 uses essentially the same definition 

several diagnostic instruments are available  two are commonly used in autism research  the autism diagnostic interview revised  adi r  is a semistructured parent interview  and the autism diagnostic observation schedule  ados  uses observation and interaction with the child  the childhood autism rating scale  cars  is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children 

a pediatrician commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child  if warranted  diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from asd specialists  observing and assessing cognitive  communication  family  and other factors using standardized tools  and taking into account any associated medical conditions  a pediatric neuropsychologist is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills  both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions  a differential diagnosis for asd at this stage might also consider intellectual disability  hearing impairment  and a specific language impairment such as landau–kleffner syndrome  the presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as depression 

clinical genetics evaluations are often done once asd is diagnosed  particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause  although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated 40  of cases to genetic causes  consensus guidelines in the us and uk are limited to high resolution chromosome and fragile x testing  a genotype first model of diagnosis has been proposed  which would routinely assess the genome s copy number variations  as new genetic tests are developed several ethical  legal  and social issues will emerge  commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results  given the complexity of autism s genetics  metabolic and neuroimaging tests are sometimes helpful  but are not routine 

asd can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months  although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life  for example  a one year old who meets diagnostic criteria for asd is less likely than a three year old to continue to do so a few years later  in the uk the national autism plan for children recommends at most 30 weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment  though few cases are handled that quickly in practice  although the symptoms of autism and asd begin early in childhood  they are sometimes missed  years later  adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves  to help their employers make adjustments  or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits 

underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases  and much of the recent increase in the number of reported asd cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices  the increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose asd  resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms  conversely  the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis  it is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the visually impaired  partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision  and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or blindisms 

autism is one of the five pervasive developmental disorders  pdd   which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication  and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior  these symptoms do not imply sickness  fragility  or emotional disturbance 

of the five pdd forms  asperger syndrome is closest to autism in signs and likely causes  rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism  but may have unrelated causes  pdd not otherwise specified  pdd nos  also called  atypical autism   is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder  unlike with autism  people with asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in language development  the terminology of autism can be bewildering  with autism  asperger syndrome and pdd nos often called the  autism spectrum disorders   asd  or sometimes the  autistic disorders   whereas autism itself is often called  autistic disorder    childhood autism   or  infantile autism   in this article   autism  refers to the classic autistic disorder  in clinical practice  though   autism    asd   and  pdd  are often used interchangeably  asd  in turn  is a subset of the broader autism phenotype  which describes individuals who may not have asd but do have autistic like traits  such as avoiding eye contact 

the manifestations of autism cover a wide spectrum  ranging from individuals with severe impairments—who may be silent  developmentally disabled  and locked into hand flapping and rocking—to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches  narrowly focused interests  and verbose  pedantic communication  because the behavior spectrum is continuous  boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary  sometimes the syndrome is divided into low   medium  or high functioning autism  lfa  mfa  and hfa   based on iq thresholds  or on how much support the individual requires in daily life  these subdivisions are not standardized and are controversial  autism can also be divided into syndromal and non syndromal autism  the syndromal autism is associated with severe or profound intellectual disability or a congenital syndrome with physical symptoms  such as tuberous sclerosis  although individuals with asperger syndrome tend to perform better cognitively than those with autism  the extent of the overlap between asperger syndrome  hfa  and non syndromal autism is unclear 

some studies have reported diagnoses of autism in children due to a loss of language or social skills  as opposed to a failure to make progress  typically from 15 to 30 months of age  the validity of this distinction remains controversial  it is possible that regressive autism is a specific subtype  or that there is a continuum of behaviors between autism with and without regression 

research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic population and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of psychiatry  psychology  neurology and pediatrics  newer technologies such as fmri and diffusion tensor imaging can help identify biologically relevant phenotypes  observable traits  that can be viewed on brain scans  to help further neurogenetic studies of autism  one example is lowered activity in the fusiform face area of the brain  which is associated with impaired perception of people versus objects  it has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior 

about half of parents of children with asd notice their child s unusual behaviors by age 18 months  and about four fifths notice by age 24 months  according to an article failure to meet any of the following milestones  is an absolute indication to proceed with further evaluations  delay in referral for such testing may delay early diagnosis and treatment and affect the long term outcome  

the united states preventative services task force in 2016 found it was unclear if screening was beneficial or harmful among children in whom there is no concerns  the japanese practice is to screen all children for asd at 18 and 24 months  using autism specific formal screening tests  in contrast  in the uk  children whose families or doctors recognize possible signs of autism are screened  it is not known which approach is more effective  screening tools include the modified checklist for autism in toddlers  m chat   the early screening of autistic traits questionnaire  and the first year inventory  initial data on m chat and its predecessor  the checklist for autism in toddlers  chat   on children aged 18–30 months suggests that it is best used in a clinical setting and that it has low sensitivity  many false negatives  but good specificity  few false positives   it may be more accurate to precede these tests with a broadband screener that does not distinguish asd from other developmental disorders  screening tools designed for one culture s norms for behaviors like eye contact may be inappropriate for a different culture  although genetic screening for autism is generally still impractical  it can be considered in some cases  such as children with neurological symptoms and dysmorphic features 

infection with rubella during pregnancy causes fewer than 1  of cases of autism  vaccination against rubella can prevent many of those cases 

the main goals when treating children with autism are to lessen associated deficits and family distress  and to increase quality of life and functional independence  in general  higher iqs are correlated with greater responsiveness to treatment and improved treatment outcomes  no single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child s needs  families and the educational system are the main resources for treatment  studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy  however the development of evidence based interventions has advanced in recent years  although many psychosocial interventions have some positive evidence  suggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no treatment  the methodological quality of systematic reviews of these studies has generally been poor  their clinical results are mostly tentative  and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options  intensive  sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire self care  social  and job skills  and often improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors  claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated  available approaches include applied behavior analysis  aba   developmental models  structured teaching  speech and language therapy  social skills therapy  and occupational therapy  among these approaches  interventions either treat autistic features comprehensively  or focalize treatment on a specific area of deficit  there is some evidence that early intensive behavioral intervention  eibi   an early intervention model based on aba for 20 to 40 hours a week for multiple years  is an effective treatment for some children with asd  two theoretical frameworks outlined for early childhood intervention include applied behavioral analysis  aba  and developmental social pragmatic models  dsp   one interventional strategy utilizes a parent training model  which teaches parents how to implement various aba and dsp techniques  allowing for parents to disseminate interventions themselves  various dsp programs have been developed to explicitly deliver intervention systems through at home parent implementation  despite the recent development of parent training models  these interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in numerous studies  being evaluated as a probable efficacious mode of treatment 

educational interventions can be effective to varying degrees in most children  intensive aba treatment has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing global functioning in preschool children and is well established for improving intellectual performance of young children  similarly  teacher implemented intervention that utilizes an aba combined with a developmental social pragmatic approach has been found to be a well established treatment in improving social communication skills in young children  although there is less evidence in its treatment of global symptoms  neuropsychological reports are often poorly communicated to educators  resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided  it is not known whether treatment programs for children lead to significant improvements after the children grow up  and the limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results  the appropriateness of including children with varying severity of autism spectrum disorders in the general education population is a subject of current debate among educators and researchers 

many medications are used to treat asd symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails  more than half of us children diagnosed with asd are prescribed psychoactive drugs or anticonvulsants  with the most common drug classes being antidepressants  stimulants  and antipsychotics  antipsychotics  such as risperidone and aripiprazole  have been found to be useful for treating irritability  repetitive behavior  and sleeplessness that often occurs with autism  however their side effects must be weighed against their potential benefits  and people with autism may respond atypically  there is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with asd  no known medication relieves autism s core symptoms of social and communication impairments  experiments in mice have reversed or reduced some symptoms related to autism by replacing or modulating gene function  suggesting the possibility of targeting therapies to specific rare mutations known to cause autism 

although many alternative therapies and interventions are available  few are supported by scientific studies  treatment approaches have little empirical support in quality of life contexts  and many programs focus on success measures that lack predictive validity and real world relevance  scientific evidence appears to matter less to service providers than program marketing  training availability  and parent requests  some alternative treatments may place the child at risk  a 2008 study found that compared to their peers  autistic boys have significantly thinner bones if on casein free diets  in 2005  botched chelation therapy killed a five year old child with autism  there has been early research looking at hyperbaric treatments in children with autism 

although popularly used as an alternative treatment for people with autism  there is no good evidence that a gluten free diet is of benefit  in the subset of people who have gluten sensitivity there is limited evidence that suggests that a gluten free diet may improve some autistic behaviors 

treatment is expensive  indirect costs are more so  for someone born in 2000  a us study estimated an average lifetime cost of    net present value in 2019 dollars  inflation adjusted from 2003 estimate   with about 10  medical care  30  extra education and other care  and 60  lost economic productivity  publicly supported programs are often inadequate or inappropriate for a given child  and unreimbursed out of pocket medical or therapy expenses are associated with likelihood of family financial problems  one 2008 us study found a 14  average loss of annual income in families of children with asd  and a related study found that asd is associated with higher probability that child care problems will greatly affect parental employment  us states increasingly require private health insurance to cover autism services  shifting costs from publicly funded education programs to privately funded health insurance  after childhood  key treatment issues include residential care  job training and placement  sexuality  social skills  and estate planning 

the emergence of the autism rights movement has served as an attempt to encourage people to be more tolerant of those with autism  through this movement  people hope to cause others to think of autism as a difference instead of a disease  proponents of this movement wish to seek “acceptance  not cures ” there have also been many worldwide events promoting autism awareness such as world autism awareness day  light it up blue  autism sunday  autistic pride day  autreat  and others  there have also been many organizations dedicated to increasing the awareness of autism and the effects that autism has on someones life  these organizations include autism speaks  autism national committee  autism society of america  and many others  social science scholars have had an increased focused on studying those with autism in hopes to learn more about “autism as a culture  transcultural comparisons… and research on social movements ” media has had an influence on how the public perceives those with autism   rain man   a film that won 4 oscars including best picture  depicts a character with autism who has incredible talents and abilities  while many autistics don t have these special abilities  there are some autistic individuals who have been successful in their fields 

there is no known cure  children recover occasionally  so that they lose their diagnosis of asd  this occurs sometimes after intensive treatment and sometimes not  it is not known how often recovery happens  reported rates in unselected samples of children with asd have ranged from 3  to 25   most children with autism acquire language by age five or younger  though a few have developed communication skills in later years  most children with autism lack social support  meaningful relationships  future employment opportunities or self determination  although core difficulties tend to persist  symptoms often become less severe with age 

few high quality studies address long term prognosis  some adults show modest improvement in communication skills  but a few decline  no study has focused on autism after midlife  acquiring language before age six  having an iq above 50  and having a marketable skill all predict better outcomes  independent living is unlikely with severe autism  most people with autism face significant obstacles in transitioning to adulthood 

most recent reviews tend to estimate a prevalence of 1–2 per 1 000 for autism and close to 6 per 1 000 for asd  and 11 per 1 000 children in the united states for asd as of 2008  because of inadequate data  these numbers may underestimate asd s true rate  globally  autism affects an estimated 21 7 million people as of 2013  while asperger syndrome affects a further 31 1 million  in 2012  the nhs estimated that the overall prevalence of autism among adults aged 18 years and over in the uk was 1 1   rates of pdd nos s has been estimated at 3 7 per 1 000  asperger syndrome at roughly 0 6 per 1 000  and childhood disintegrative disorder at 0 02 per 1 000  cdc s most recent estimate is that 1 out of every 68 children  or 14 7 per 1 000  has an asd as of 2010 

the number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically in the 1990s and early 2000s  this increase is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices  referral patterns  availability of services  age at diagnosis  and public awareness  though unidentified environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out  the available evidence does not rule out the possibility that autism s true prevalence has increased  a real increase would suggest directing more attention and funding toward changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics 

boys are at higher risk for asd than girls  the sex ratio averages 4 3 1 and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment  it may be close to 2 1 with intellectual disability and more than 5 5 1 without  several theories about the higher prevalence in males have been investigated  but the cause of the difference is unconfirmed  one theory is that females are underdiagnosed 

although the evidence does not implicate any single pregnancy related risk factor as a cause of autism  the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent  and with diabetes  bleeding  and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy  the risk is greater with older fathers than with older mothers  two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm  and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism  most professionals believe that race  ethnicity  and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism 

several other conditions are common in children with autism  they include 

a few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named  the  table talk  of martin luther  compiled by his notetaker  mathesius  contains the story of a 12 year old boy who may have been severely autistic  luther reportedly thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil  and suggested that he be suffocated  although a later critic has cast doubt on the veracity of this report  the earliest well documented case of autism is that of hugh blair of borgue  as detailed in a 1747 court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul blair s marriage to gain blair s inheritance  the wild boy of aveyron  a feral child caught in 1798  showed several signs of autism  the medical student jean itard treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation 

the new latin word  autismus   english translation  autism   was coined by the swiss psychiatrist eugen bleuler in 1910 as he was defining symptoms of schizophrenia  he derived it from the greek word  autós   αὐτός  meaning  self    and used it to mean morbid self admiration  referring to  autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies  against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance  

the word  autism  first took its modern sense in 1938 when hans asperger of the vienna university hospital adopted bleuler s terminology  autistic psychopaths  in a lecture in german about child psychology  asperger was investigating an asd now known as asperger syndrome  though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981  leo kanner of the johns hopkins hospital first used  autism  in its modern sense in english when he introduced the label  early infantile autism  in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities  almost all the characteristics described in kanner s first paper on the subject  notably  autistic aloneness  and  insistence on sameness   are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders  it is not known whether kanner derived the term independently of asperger 

kanner s reuse of  autism  led to decades of confused terminology like  infantile schizophrenia   and child psychiatry s focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant s response to  refrigerator mothers   starting in the late 1960s autism was established as a separate syndrome by demonstrating that it is lifelong  distinguishing it from intellectual disability and schizophrenia and from other developmental disorders  and demonstrating the benefits of involving parents in active programs of therapy  as late as the mid 1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism  now it is thought to be one of the most heritable of all psychiatric conditions  although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood asd have deeply affected how we view asd  parents continue to feel social stigma in situations where their child s autistic behavior is perceived negatively by others  and many primary care physicians and medical specialists still express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research 

the internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find so hard to deal with  and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely  sociological and cultural aspects of autism have developed  some in the community seek a cure  while others believe that autism is simply another way of being
