Anarchism

Anarchism is a <a href="political%20philosophy">political philosophy</a> that advocates <a href="self-governance">self-governed</a> societies based on voluntary institutions. These are often described as <a href="stateless%20society">stateless societies</a>, although several authors have defined them more specifically as institutions based on non-<a href="Hierarchy">hierarchical</a> <a href="Free%20association%20%28communism%20and%20anarchism%29">free associations</a>. Anarchism considers the <a href="state%20%28polity%29">state</a> to be undesirable, unnecessary, and harmful, because anarchists generally believe that human beings are capable of managing their own affairs on the basis of creativity, cooperation, and mutual respect, and when making individual decisions they are taking into account the concerns of others and the well-being of society.
While <a href="anti-statism">anti-statism</a> is central, anarchism entails opposing <a href="authority">authority</a> or <a href="hierarchical%20organisation">hierarchical organisation</a> in the conduct of all human relations.

Anarchism draws on many currents of thought and strategy. Anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view, instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy. Many types and traditions of anarchism exist, not all of which are mutually exclusive. <a href="Anarchist%20schools%20of%20thought">Anarchist schools of thought</a> can differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme <a href="individualism">individualism</a> to complete collectivism. Strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of <a href="social%20anarchism">social</a> and <a href="individualist%20anarchism">individualist anarchism</a> or similar dual classifications. Anarchism is usually considered a radical <a href="left-wing">left-wing</a> ideology, and much of <a href="anarchist%20economics">anarchist economics</a> and <a href="anarchist%20law">anarchist legal philosophy</a> reflect <a href="Libertarian%20socialism">anti-authoritarian interpretations</a> of <a href="anarcho-communism">communism</a>, <a href="collectivist%20anarchism">collectivism</a>, <a href="anarcho-syndicalism">syndicalism</a>, <a href="Mutualism%20%28economic%20theory%29">mutualism</a>, or <a href="participatory%20economics">participatory economics</a>.

The term "<a href="wikt%3Aanarchism">anarchism</a>" is a compound word composed from the word "<a href="anarchy">anarchy</a>" and the suffix "<a href="-ism">-ism</a>", themselves derived respectively from the Greek , i.e. "anarchy" (from , "anarchos", meaning "one without rulers"; from the <a href="privative">privative</a> prefix <a href="privative%20alpha">ἀν</a>- ("an-", i.e. "without") and , "archos", i.e. "leader", "ruler"; (cf. "<a href="archon">archon</a>" or , "arkhē", i.e. "authority", "sovereignty", "realm", "magistracy")) and the suffix or ("-ismos", "-isma", from the verbal <a href="infinitive">infinitive</a> suffix -ίζειν, "-izein"). The first known use of this word was in 1539. Various factions within the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> labelled opponents as anarchists (as <a href="Maximilien%20de%20Robespierre">Robespierre</a> did the <a href="H%C3%A9bertists">Hébertists</a>) although few shared many views of later anarchists. There would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation, such as <a href="William%20Godwin">William Godwin</a> and <a href="Wilhelm%20Weitling">Wilhelm Weitling</a>, but they did not use the word "anarchist" or "anarchism" in describing themselves or their beliefs.

The first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was <a href="Pierre-Joseph%20Proudhon">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a>, marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-nineteenth century. Since the 1890s, and beginning in France, the term "libertarianism" has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and was used almost exclusively in this sense until the 1950s in the United States; its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States. On the other hand, some use "<a href="libertarianism">libertarianism</a>" to refer to individualistic free-market philosophy only, referring to free-market anarchism as "<a href="libertarian%20anarchism">libertarian anarchism</a>".

The earliest anarchist themes can be found in the 6th century BC, among the works of <a href="Taoism">Taoist</a> philosopher <a href="Laozi">Laozi</a>, and in later centuries by <a href="Zhuang%20Zhou">Zhuangzi</a> and Bao Jingyan. Zhuangzi's philosophy has been described by various sources as anarchist. Zhuangzi wrote, "A petty thief is put in jail. A great <a href="wikt%3Abrigand">brigand</a> becomes a ruler of a Nation." <a href="Diogenes%20of%20Sinope">Diogenes of Sinope</a> and the <a href="Cynicism%20%28philosophy%29">Cynics</a>, their contemporary <a href="Zeno%20of%20Citium">Zeno of Citium</a>, the founder of <a href="Stoicism">Stoicism</a>, also introduced similar topics. <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a> is sometimes considered the first anarchist in the <a href="Christian%20anarchism">Christian anarchist</a> tradition. Georges Lechartier wrote that "The true founder of anarchy was Jesus <a href="Christ">Christ</a> and ... the first anarchist society was that of the <a href="Apostle%20%28Christian%29">apostles</a>." In early <a href="History%20of%20Islam">Islamic history</a>, some manifestations of anarchic thought are found during the <a href="Second%20Fitna">Islamic civil war</a> over the <a href="Caliphate">Caliphate</a>, where the <a href="Kharijites">Kharijites</a> insisted that the <a href="imamate">imamate</a> is a right for each individual within the Islamic society. Later, some <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> scholars, such as Amer al-Basri and <a href="Abu%20Hanifa">Abu Hanifa</a>, led movements of boycotting the rulers, paving the way to the <a href="waqf">waqf</a> (endowments) tradition, which served as an alternative to and asylum from the centralised authorities of the emirs. But such interpretations reverberates subversive religious conceptions like the aforementioned seemingly anarchistic Taoist teachings and that of other anti-authoritarian religious traditions creating a complex relationship regarding the question as to whether or not <a href="Anarchism%20and%20religion">anarchism and religion are compatible</a>. This is exemplified when the glorification of the state is viewed as a form of sinful <a href="idolatry">idolatry</a>.

The French <a href="Renaissance%20humanism">renaissance</a> political philosopher <a href="%C3%89tienne%20de%20La%20Bo%C3%A9tie">Étienne de La Boétie</a> wrote in his most famous work the "Discourse on Voluntary Servitude" what some historians consider an important anarchist precedent. The radical <a href="Protestant%20Christianity">Protestant Christian</a> <a href="Gerrard%20Winstanley">Gerrard Winstanley</a> and his group the <a href="Diggers">Diggers</a> are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the 17th century in England. The term "anarchist" first entered the English language in 1642, during the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a>, as a <a href="Pejorative">term of abuse</a>, used by <a href="Cavalier">Royalists</a> against their <a href="Roundhead">Roundhead</a> opponents. By the time of the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> some, such as the "<a href="Enrag%C3%A9s">Enragés</a>", began to use the term positively, in opposition to <a href="Jacobin%20%28politics%29">Jacobin</a> centralisation of power, seeing "revolutionary government" as <a href="oxymoron">oxymoronic</a>. By the turn of the 19th century, the English word "anarchism" had lost its initial negative connotation.

Modern anarchism sprang from the secular or religious thought of the <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a>, particularly <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>'s arguments for the moral centrality of freedom.

As part of the political turmoil of the 1790s in the wake of the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>, <a href="William%20Godwin">William Godwin</a> developed the first expression of <a href="anarchist%20schools%20of%20thought">modern anarchist thought</a>. Godwin was, according to <a href="Peter%20Kropotkin">Peter Kropotkin</a>, "the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work", while Godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early <a href="Edmund%20Burke">Edmund Burke</a>.
Godwin is generally regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as 'philosophical anarchism'. He argued in "<a href="Political%20Justice">Political Justice</a>" (1793) that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society, and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance. He thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force. Although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy, he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power. Rather, he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution.

His aversion to the imposition of a rules-based society led him to denounce, as a manifestation of the people’s ‘mental enslavement’, the foundations of law, <a href="property%20rights">property rights</a> and even the institution of marriage. He considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organization. In each case, government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgement.

The French <a href="Pierre-Joseph%20Proudhon">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a> is regarded as the first "self-proclaimed" anarchist, a label he adopted in his groundbreaking work, "<a href="What%20is%20Property%3F">What is Property?</a>," published in 1840. It is for this reason that some claim Proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory. He developed the theory of <a href="spontaneous%20order">spontaneous order</a> in society, where organisation emerges without a central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests; his famous quote on the matter is, "Liberty is the mother, not the daughter, of order." In "What is Property?" Proudhon answers with the famous accusation "<a href="Property%20is%20theft">Property is theft</a>." In this work, he opposed the institution of decreed "property" ("propriété"), where owners have complete rights to "use and abuse" their property as they wish. He contrasted this with what he called "possession," or limited ownership of resources and goods only while in more or less continuous use. Later, however, Proudhon added that "Property is Liberty," and argued that it was a bulwark against state power. His opposition to the state, organised religion, and certain capitalist practices inspired subsequent anarchists, and made him one of the leading social thinkers of his time.

The anarcho-communist <a href="Joseph%20D%C3%A9jacque">Joseph Déjacque</a> was the first person to describe himself as "<a href="libertarian%20socialism">libertarian</a>". Unlike <a href="Pierre-Joseph%20Proudhon">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a>, he argued that, "it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature." In 1844 in Germany the post-hegelian philosopher <a href="Max%20Stirner">Max Stirner</a> published the book, "<a href="The%20Ego%20and%20Its%20Own">The Ego and Its Own</a>," which would later be considered an influential early text of <a href="individualist%20anarchism">individualist anarchism</a>. French anarchists active in the <a href="1848%20Revolution">1848 Revolution</a> included <a href="Anselme%20Bellegarrigue">Anselme Bellegarrigue</a>, Ernest Coeurderoy, <a href="Joseph%20D%C3%A9jacque">Joseph Déjacque</a> and <a href="Pierre%20Joseph%20Proudhon">Pierre Joseph Proudhon</a>.

In Europe, harsh reaction followed the <a href="revolutions%20of%201848">revolutions of 1848</a>, during which ten countries had experienced brief or long-term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings. After most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure, conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists, anarchists, liberals, and nationalists, to prevent further revolt. In Spain Ramón de la Sagra established the anarchist journal "El Porvenir" in La Coruña in 1845 which was inspired by Proudhon´s ideas. The <a href="Catalan%20people">Catalan</a> politician <a href="Francesc%20Pi%20i%20Margall">Francesc Pi i Margall</a> became the principal translator of Proudhon's works into Spanish and later briefly became president of Spain in 1873 while being the leader of the Democratic Republican Federal Party. According to <a href="George%20Woodcock">George Woodcock</a> "These translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of Spanish anarchism after 1870, but before that time Proudhonian ideas, as interpreted by Pi, already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early 1860's." According to the "<a href="Encyclopedia%20Britannica">Encyclopedia Britannica</a>" "During the Spanish revolution of 1873, Pi y Margall <a href="Cantonal%20Revolution">attempted to establish a decentralized, or "cantonalist," political system</a> on Proudhonian lines."

In 1864 the <a href="International%20Workingmen%27s%20Association">International Workingmen's Association</a> (sometimes called the "First International") united diverse revolutionary currents including French followers of <a href="Pierre-Joseph%20Proudhon">Proudhon</a>, <a href="Blanquism">Blanquists</a>, <a href="Philadelphes">Philadelphes</a>, English trade unionists, socialists and <a href="social%20democrats">social democrats</a>. Due to its links to active workers' movements, the International became a significant organisation. <a href="Karl%20Marx">Karl Marx</a> became a leading figure in the International and a member of its General Council. Proudhon's followers, the <a href="Mutualism%20%28economic%20theory%29">mutualists</a>, opposed Marx's <a href="state%20socialism">state socialism</a>, advocating political <a href="abstentionism">abstentionism</a> and small property holdings. Woodcock also reports that the American individualist anarchists <a href="Lysander%20Spooner">Lysander Spooner</a> and <a href="William%20B.%20Greene">William B. Greene</a> had been members of the <a href="First%20International">First International</a>. In 1868, following their unsuccessful participation in the <a href="League%20of%20Peace%20and%20Freedom">League of Peace and Freedom</a> (LPF), Russian revolutionary <a href="Mikhail%20Bakunin">Mikhail Bakunin</a> and his <a href="collectivist%20anarchism">collectivist anarchist</a> associates joined the First International (which had decided not to get involved with the LPF). They allied themselves with the <a href="federalist">federalist</a> socialist sections of the International, who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivisation of property.

At first, the collectivists worked with the Marxists to push the First International in a more revolutionary socialist direction. Subsequently, the International became polarised into two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads. Bakunin characterised Marx's ideas as <a href="centralism">centralist</a> and predicted that, if a Marxist party came to power, its leaders would simply take the place of the <a href="ruling%20class">ruling class</a> they had fought against. Anarchist historian <a href="George%20Woodcock">George Woodcock</a> reports that "The annual Congress of the International had not taken place in 1870 owing to the outbreak of the Paris Commune, and in 1871 the General Council called only a special conference in London. One delegate was able to attend from Spain and none from Italy, while a technical excuse – that they had split away from the Fédération Romande – was used to avoid inviting Bakunin's Swiss supporters. Thus only a tiny minority of anarchists was present, and the General Council's resolutions passed almost unanimously. Most of them were clearly directed against Bakunin and his followers." In 1872, the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the <a href="Hague%20Congress%20%281872%29">Hague Congress</a>, where Bakunin and <a href="James%20Guillaume">James Guillaume</a> were expelled from the International and its headquarters were transferred to New York. In response, the federalist sections formed their own International at the <a href="Anarchist%20St.%20Imier%20International">St. Imier Congress</a>, adopting a revolutionary anarchist program.

The <a href="Paris%20Commune">Paris Commune</a> was a government that briefly ruled Paris from 18 March (more formally, from 28 March) to 28 May 1871. The Commune was the result of an uprising in Paris after France was defeated in the Franco-Prussian War. Anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the Paris Commune. They included <a href="Louise%20Michel">Louise Michel</a>, the Reclus brothers, and <a href="Eugene%20Varlin">Eugene Varlin</a> (the latter murdered in the repression afterwards). As for the reforms initiated by the Commune, such as the re-opening of workplaces as co-operatives, anarchists can see their ideas of associated labour beginning to be realised ... Moreover, the Commune's ideas on federation obviously reflected the influence of <a href="Pierre-Joseph%20Proudhon">Proudhon</a> on French radical ideas. Indeed, the Commune's vision of a communal France based on a federation of delegates bound by imperative mandates issued by their electors and subject to recall at any moment echoes Bakunin's and Proudhon's ideas (Proudhon, like Bakunin, had argued in favour of the "implementation of the binding mandate" in 1848 ... and for federation of communes). Thus both economically and politically the Paris Commune was heavily influenced by anarchist ideas. George Woodcock states:

The anti-authoritarian sections of the First International were the precursors of the anarcho-syndicalists, seeking to "replace the privilege and authority of the State" with the "free and spontaneous organisation of labour." In 1886, the <a href="Federation%20of%20Organized%20Trades%20and%20Labor%20Unions">Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions</a> (FOTLU) of the United States and Canada unanimously set 1 May 1886, as the date by which the <a href="Eight-hour%20day">eight-hour work day</a> would become standard.

In response, unions across the United States prepared a <a href="general%20strike">general strike</a> in support of the event. On 3 May, in Chicago, a fight broke out when <a href="strikebreaker">strikebreakers</a> attempted to cross the picket line, and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd. The next day, 4 May, anarchists staged a rally at Chicago's Haymarket Square. A bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally, killing an officer. In the ensuing panic, police opened fire on the crowd and each other. Seven police officers and at least four workers were killed. Eight anarchists directly and indirectly related to the organisers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer. The men became international political celebrities among the labour movement. Four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution. The incident became known as the <a href="Haymarket%20affair">Haymarket affair</a>, and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight-hour day. In 1890 a second attempt, this time international in scope, to organise for the eight-hour day was made. The event also had the secondary purpose of memorialising workers killed as a result of the Haymarket affair. Although it had initially been conceived as a once-off event, by the following year the celebration of <a href="International%20Workers%27%20Day">International Workers' Day</a> on May Day had become firmly established as an international worker's holiday.

In 1907, the <a href="International%20Anarchist%20Congress%20of%20Amsterdam">International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam</a> gathered delegates from 14 different countries, among which important figures of the anarchist movement, including <a href="Errico%20Malatesta">Errico Malatesta</a>, <a href="Pierre%20Monatte">Pierre Monatte</a>, <a href="Luigi%20Fabbri">Luigi Fabbri</a>, <a href="Beno%C3%AEt%20Broutchoux">Benoît Broutchoux</a>, <a href="Emma%20Goldman">Emma Goldman</a>, <a href="Rudolf%20Rocker">Rudolf Rocker</a>, and <a href="Christiaan%20Cornelissen">Christiaan Cornelissen</a>. Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, <a href="popular%20education">popular education</a> issues, the <a href="general%20strike">general strike</a> or <a href="antimilitarism">antimilitarism</a>. A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and <a href="syndicalism">syndicalism</a> (or <a href="trade%20union">trade unionism</a>). Malatesta and Monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue, as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a <a href="social%20revolution">social revolution</a>, while Malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient. He thought that the trade-union movement was <a href="reformism">reformist</a> and even <a href="Conservatism">conservative</a>, citing as essentially bourgeois and anti-worker the phenomenon of professional union officials. Malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself, whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it.

The <a href="Federaci%C3%B3n%20Anarquista%20Ib%C3%A9rica">Spanish Workers Federation</a> in 1881 was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement; anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain. The most successful was the <a href="Confederaci%C3%B3n%20Nacional%20del%20Trabajo">Confederación Nacional del Trabajo</a> (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Before the 1940s, the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics, attracting 1.58 million members at one point and playing a major role in the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>. The CNT was affiliated with the <a href="International%20Workers%20Association">International Workers Association</a>, a federation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922, with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in Europe and Latin America. In Latin America in particular "The anarchists quickly became active in organizing craft and industrial workers throughout South and Central America, and until the early 1920s most of the trade unions in <a href="Anarchism%20in%20Mexico">Mexico</a>, <a href="Anarchism%20in%20Brazil">Brazil</a>, Peru, Chile, and Argentina were anarcho-syndicalist in general outlook; the prestige of the Spanish C.N.T. as a revolutionary organization was undoubtedly to a great extent responsible for this situation. The largest and most militant of these organizations was the <a href="Federaci%C3%B3n%20Obrera%20Regional%20Argentina">Federación Obrera Regional Argentina</a> ... it grew quickly to a membership of nearly a quarter of a million, which dwarfed the rival socialdemocratic unions."
Some anarchists, such as <a href="Johann%20Most">Johann Most</a>, advocated publicising violent acts of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries because "we preach not only action in and for itself, but also action as propaganda." By the 1880s, people inside and outside the anarchist movement began to use the slogan, "propaganda of the deed" to refer to individual bombings, <a href="regicide">regicides</a>, and <a href="tyrannicide">tyrannicides</a>. From 1905 onwards, the Russian counterparts of these anti-syndicalist anarchist-communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal '<a href="Confiscation">expropriations</a>'." <a href="Illegalism">Illegalism</a> as a practice emerged and within it "The acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins ("<a href="propaganda%20by%20the%20deed">propaganda by the deed</a>") and the anarchist burglars ("<a href="individual%20reappropriation">individual reappropriation</a>") expressed their desperation and their personal, violent rejection of an intolerable society. Moreover, they were clearly meant to be "exemplary" invitations to revolt.". France's <a href="Bonnot%20Gang">Bonnot Gang</a> was the most famous group to embrace illegalism.

However, as soon as 1887, important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts. <a href="Peter%20Kropotkin">Peter Kropotkin</a> thus wrote that year in "Le Révolté" that "a structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite". A variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favour of collective revolutionary action, for example through the <a href="trade%20union">trade union</a> movement. The <a href="anarcho-syndicalism">anarcho-syndicalist</a>, <a href="Fernand%20Pelloutier">Fernand Pelloutier</a>, argued in 1895 for renewed anarchist involvement in the labour movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without "the individual dynamiter."

<a href="Political%20repression">State repression</a> (including the infamous 1894 French "<a href="lois%20sc%C3%A9l%C3%A9rates">lois scélérates</a>") of the anarchist and <a href="labour%20movement">labour movements</a> following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics, although reciprocally state repression, in the first place, may have played a role in these isolated acts. The dismemberment of the French <a href="socialist%20movement">socialist movement</a>, into many groups and, following the suppression of the 1871 <a href="Paris%20Commune">Paris Commune</a>, the execution and exile of many "<a href="communards">communards</a>" to <a href="penal%20colonies">penal colonies</a>, favoured individualist political expression and acts.

Numerous heads of state were assassinated between 1881 and 1914 by members of the anarchist movement, including Tsar <a href="Alexander%20II%20of%20Russia">Alexander II of Russia</a>, President <a href="Marie%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Sadi%20Carnot">Sadi Carnot</a> of France, <a href="Empress%20Elisabeth%20of%20Austria">Empress Elisabeth of Austria</a>, King <a href="Umberto%20I%20of%20Italy">Umberto I of Italy</a>, President <a href="William%20McKinley">William McKinley</a> of the United States, King <a href="Carlos%20I%20of%20Portugal">Carlos I of Portugal</a> and King <a href="George%20I%20of%20Greece">George I of Greece</a>. McKinley's assassin <a href="Leon%20Czolgosz">Leon Czolgosz</a> claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and <a href="feminist">feminist</a> <a href="Emma%20Goldman">Emma Goldman</a>.

Propaganda of the deed was abandoned by the vast majority of the anarchist movement after World War I (1914–1918) and the <a href="1917%20October%20Revolution">1917 October Revolution</a>.

Anarchists participated alongside the <a href="Bolshevik">Bolsheviks</a> in both <a href="February%20Revolution">February</a> and <a href="October%20Revolution">October revolutions</a>, and were initially enthusiastic about the Bolshevik revolution. However, following a political falling out with the Bolsheviks by the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, the conflict culminated in the 1921 <a href="Kronstadt%20rebellion">Kronstadt rebellion</a>, which the new government repressed. Anarchists in central Russia were either imprisoned, driven underground or joined the victorious Bolsheviks; the anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>. There, in the <a href="Free%20Territory%20%28Ukraine%29">Free Territory</a>, they fought in the <a href="Russian%20Civil%20War">civil war</a> against the <a href="White%20movement">Whites</a> (a grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the October Revolution) and then the Bolsheviks as part of the <a href="Revolutionary%20Insurrectionary%20Army%20of%20Ukraine">Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine</a> led by <a href="Nestor%20Makhno">Nestor Makhno</a>, who established an anarchist society in the region for a number of months.

Expelled American anarchists <a href="Emma%20Goldman">Emma Goldman</a> and <a href="Alexander%20Berkman">Alexander Berkman</a> were among those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the <a href="Kronstadt%20rebellion">Kronstadt uprising</a>, before they left Russia. Both wrote accounts of their experiences in Russia, criticising the amount of control the Bolsheviks exercised. For them, <a href="Mikhail%20Bakunin">Bakunin</a>'s predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule that the rulers of the new "socialist" Marxist state would become a new elite had proved all too true.

The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; <a href="Communist%20party">Communist parties</a> grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the United States, for example, members of the major syndicalist movements of the <a href="Conf%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20g%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale%20du%20travail">CGT</a> and <a href="Industrial%20Workers%20of%20the%20World">IWW</a> left the organisations and joined the <a href="Comintern">Communist International</a>.

The <a href="Revolutions%20of%201917%E2%80%9323">revolutionary wave of 1917–23</a> saw the active participation of anarchists in varying degrees of protagonism. In the German uprising known as the <a href="German%20Revolution%20of%201918%E2%80%931919">German Revolution of 1918–1919</a> which established the <a href="Bavarian%20Soviet%20Republic">Bavarian Soviet Republic</a> the anarchists <a href="Gustav%20Landauer">Gustav Landauer</a>, <a href="Silvio%20Gesell">Silvio Gesell</a> and <a href="Erich%20M%C3%BChsam">Erich Mühsam</a> had important leadership positions within the revolutionary <a href="Council%20communism">councilist</a> structures. In the Italian events known as the "<a href="biennio%20rosso">biennio rosso</a>" the anarcho-syndicalist trade union <a href="Unione%20Sindacale%20Italiana">Unione Sindacale Italiana</a> "grew to 800,000 members and the influence of the Italian Anarchist Union (20,000 members plus "<a href="Umanita%20Nova">Umanita Nova</a>", its daily paper) grew accordingly ... Anarchists were the first to suggest occupying workplaces. In the <a href="Mexican%20Revolution">Mexican Revolution</a> the <a href="Mexican%20Liberal%20Party">Mexican Liberal Party</a> was established and during the early 1910s it led a series of military offensives leading to the conquest and occupation of certain towns and districts in <a href="Baja%20California">Baja California</a> with the leadership of anarcho-communist <a href="Ricardo%20Flores%20Mag%C3%B3n">Ricardo Flores Magón</a>.

In Paris, the <a href="Dielo%20Truda">Dielo Truda</a> group of Russian anarchist exiles, which included <a href="Nestor%20Makhno">Nestor Makhno</a>, concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism. Their 1926 manifesto, called the "<a href="Platformism">Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)</a>", was supported. <a href="Platformist">Platformist</a> groups active today include the <a href="Workers%20Solidarity%20Movement">Workers Solidarity Movement</a> in Ireland and the <a href="NEFAC">North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists</a> of North America. <a href="Synthesis%20anarchism">Synthesis anarchism</a> emerged as an organisational alternative to platformism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of <a href="anarchism%20without%20adjectives">anarchism without adjectives</a>. In the 1920s this form found as its main proponents <a href="Volin">Volin</a> and <a href="Sebastien%20Faure">Sebastien Faure</a>. It is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global <a href="International%20of%20Anarchist%20Federations">International of Anarchist Federations</a>.

In the 1920s and 1930s, the rise of fascism in Europe transformed anarchism's conflict with the state. Italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and fascists. <a href="Anarchism%20in%20Italy">Italian anarchists</a> played a key role in the <a href="Anti-fascism">anti-fascist</a> organisation "<a href="Arditi%20del%20Popolo">Arditi del Popolo</a>", which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions, and achieved some success in their activism, such as repelling <a href="Blackshirts">Blackshirts</a> in the anarchist stronghold of <a href="Parma">Parma</a> in August 1922. The veteran Italian anarchist, <a href="Luigi%20Fabbri">Luigi Fabbri</a>, was one of the first critical theorists of fascism, describing it as "the preventive counter-revolution." In France, where the <a href="far%20right%20leagues">far right leagues</a> came close to insurrection in the <a href="6%20February%201934%20crisis">February 1934 riots</a>, anarchists divided over a <a href="united%20front">united front</a> policy.

Anarchists in <a href="Anarchism%20in%20France">France</a> and <a href="Anarchism%20in%20Italy">Italy</a> were active in the <a href="Resistance%20during%20World%20War%20II">Resistance during World War II</a>. In Germany the anarchist <a href="Erich%20M%C3%BChsam">Erich Mühsam</a> was arrested on charges unknown in the early morning hours of 28 February 1933, within a few hours after the <a href="Reichstag%20fire">Reichstag fire</a> in Berlin. <a href="Joseph%20Goebbels">Joseph Goebbels</a>, the Nazi <a href="Propagandaministerium">propaganda minister</a>, labelled him as one of "those Jewish subversives." Over the next seventeen months, he would be imprisoned in the concentration camps at <a href="Sonnenburg">Sonnenburg</a>, Brandenburg and finally, <a href="Oranienburg">Oranienburg</a>. On 2 February 1934, Mühsam was transferred to the <a href="Nazi%20concentration%20camps">concentration camp</a> at <a href="Oranienburg%20concentration%20camp">Oranienburg</a> when finally on the night of 9 July 1934, Mühsam was tortured and murdered by the guards, his battered corpse found hanging in a latrine the next morning.

In Spain, the national anarcho-syndicalist trade union <a href="Confederaci%C3%B3n%20Nacional%20del%20Trabajo">Confederación Nacional del Trabajo</a> initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the former ruling class responded with an attempted coup causing the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a> (1936–1939). In response to the army rebellion, an <a href="Anarchism%20in%20Spain">anarchist-inspired</a> movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a> and of large areas of rural Spain where they <a href="Collective%20farming">collectivised</a> the land. But even before the fascist victory in 1939, the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the <a href="Stalinism">Stalinists</a>, who controlled much of the distribution of military aid to the Republican cause from the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. According to <a href="Noam%20Chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a>, "the communists were mainly responsible for the destruction of the Spanish anarchists. Not just in Catalonia—the communist armies mainly destroyed the collectives elsewhere. The communists basically acted as the police force of the security system of the Republic and were very much opposed to the anarchists, partially because Stalin still hoped at that time to have some kind of pact with Western countries against Hitler. That, of course, failed and Stalin withdrew the support to the Republic. They even withdrew the Spanish gold reserves." The events known as the Spanish Revolution was a workers' <a href="social%20revolution">social revolution</a> that began during the outbreak of the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a> in 1936 and resulted in the widespread implementation of <a href="Anarchism%20in%20Spain">anarchist</a> and more broadly <a href="libertarian%20socialist">libertarian socialist</a> organisational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years, primarily <a href="Catalonia">Catalonia</a>, <a href="Anarchist%20Aragon">Aragon</a>, <a href="Andalusia">Andalusia</a>, and parts of <a href="Levante%2C%20Spain">the Levante</a>. Much of <a href="Spain%27s%20economy">Spain's economy</a> was put under worker control; in anarchist strongholds like <a href="Catalonia">Catalonia</a>, the figure was as high as 75%, but lower in areas with heavy <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Spain%20%28main%29">Communist Party of Spain</a> influence, as the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a>-allied party actively resisted attempts at <a href="collectivisation">collectivisation</a> enactment. Factories were run through worker committees, <a href="agriculture">agrarian</a> areas became collectivised and run as <a href="Libertarian%20socialism">libertarian</a> <a href="commune%20%28intentional%20community%29">communes</a>. Anarchist historian <a href="Sam%20Dolgoff">Sam Dolgoff</a> estimated that about eight million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the Spanish Revolution, which he claimed "came closer to realizing the ideal of the free stateless society on a vast scale than any other revolution in history." <a href="Spanish%20Communist%20Party">Spanish Communist Party</a>-led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both <a href="Workers%27%20Party%20of%20Marxist%20Unification">dissident Marxists</a> and anarchists. The prominent Italian anarchist <a href="Camillo%20Berneri">Camillo Berneri</a>, who volunteered to fight against Franco was killed instead in Spain by gunmen associated with the <a href="Spanish%20Communist%20Party">Spanish Communist Party</a>. The city of Madrid was turned over to the francoist forces by the last non-francoist mayor of the city, the anarchist <a href="Melchor%20Rodr%C3%ADguez%20Garc%C3%ADa">Melchor Rodríguez García</a>.

Anarchism sought to reorganise itself after the war and in this context the organisational debate between <a href="synthesis%20anarchism">synthesis anarchism</a> and <a href="platformism">platformism</a> took importance once again especially in the <a href="Anarchism%20in%20Italy%23Postwar%20years%20and%20today">anarchist movements of Italy</a> and <a href="Anarchism%20in%20France%23The%20Fourth%20Republic%20%281945%E2%80%931958%29">France</a>. The <a href="Mexican%20Anarchist%20Federation">Mexican Anarchist Federation</a> was established in 1945 after the Anarchist Federation of the Centre united with the Anarchist Federation of the Federal District. In the early 1940s, the Antifascist International Solidarity and the Federation of Anarchist Groups of Cuba merged into the large national organisation Asociación Libertaria de Cuba (Cuban Libertarian Association). From 1944 to 1947, the Bulgarian Anarchist Communist Federation reemerged as part of a factory and workplace committee movement, but was repressed by the new Communist regime. In 1945 in <a href="Anarchism%20in%20France">France</a> the <a href="F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20Anarchiste">Fédération Anarchiste</a> and the anarchosyndicalist trade union <a href="Conf%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20nationale%20du%20travail">Confédération nationale du travail</a> was established in the next year while the also <a href="Synthesist%20anarchism">synthesist</a> <a href="Federazione%20Anarchica%20Italiana">Federazione Anarchica Italiana</a> was founded in <a href="Anarchism%20in%20Italy">Italy</a>. Korean anarchists formed the League of Free Social Constructors in September 1945 and in 1946 the <a href="Japanese%20Anarchist%20Federation">Japanese Anarchist Federation</a> was founded. An International Anarchist Congress with delegates from across Europe was held in Paris in May 1948. After World War II, an appeal in the "<a href="Fraye%20Arbeter%20Shtime">Fraye Arbeter Shtime</a>" detailing the plight of <a href="Anarchism%20in%20Germany">German anarchists</a> and called for Americans to support them. By February 1946, the sending of aid parcels to anarchists in Germany was a large-scale operation. The Federation of Libertarian Socialists was founded in Germany in 1947 and <a href="Rudolf%20Rocker">Rudolf Rocker</a> wrote for its organ, "Die Freie Gesellschaft", which survived until 1953. In 1956 the <a href="Uruguayan%20Anarchist%20Federation">Uruguayan Anarchist Federation</a> was founded. In 1955 the Anarcho-Communist Federation of Argentina renamed itself as the <a href="Argentine%20Libertarian%20Federation">Argentine Libertarian Federation</a>. The <a href="Syndicalist%20Workers%27%20Federation">Syndicalist Workers' Federation</a> was a syndicalist group in active in post-war Britain, and one of <a href="Solidarity%20Federation">Solidarity Federation</a>'s earliest predecessors. It was formed in 1950 by members of the dissolved Anarchist Federation of Britain. Unlike the AFB, which was influenced by anarcho-syndicalist ideas but ultimately not syndicalist itself, the SWF decided to pursue a more definitely <a href="syndicalism">syndicalist</a>, worker-centred strategy from the outset.

Anarchism continued to influence important literary and intellectual personalities of the time, such as <a href="Albert%20Camus">Albert Camus</a>, <a href="Herbert%20Read">Herbert Read</a>, <a href="Paul%20Goodman%20%28writer%29">Paul Goodman</a>, <a href="Dwight%20Macdonald">Dwight Macdonald</a>, <a href="Allen%20Ginsberg">Allen Ginsberg</a>, <a href="George%20Woodcock">George Woodcock</a>, <a href="Leopold%20Kohr">Leopold Kohr</a>, <a href="Julian%20Beck">Julian Beck</a>, <a href="John%20Cage">John Cage</a> and the French <a href="Surrealism">Surrealist</a> group led by <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Breton">André Breton</a>, which now openly embraced anarchism and collaborated in the <a href="F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20Anarchiste">Fédération Anarchiste</a>.

<a href="Anarcho-pacifism">Anarcho-pacifism</a> became influential in the <a href="Anti-nuclear%20movement">Anti-nuclear movement</a> and <a href="anti%20war%20movement">anti war movements</a> of the time as can be seen in the activism and writings of the English anarchist member of <a href="Campaign%20for%20Nuclear%20Disarmament">Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament</a> <a href="Alex%20Comfort">Alex Comfort</a> or the similar activism of the American catholic anarcho-pacifists <a href="Ammon%20Hennacy">Ammon Hennacy</a> and <a href="Dorothy%20Day">Dorothy Day</a>. Anarcho-pacifism became a "basis for a critique of militarism on both sides of the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>." The resurgence of anarchist ideas during this period is well documented in Robert Graham's , "Volume Two: The Emergence of the New Anarchism (1939–1977)".

 A surge of popular interest in anarchism occurred in western nations during the 1960s and 1970s. Anarchism was influential in the <a href="Counterculture%20of%20the%201960s">Counterculture of the 1960s</a> and anarchists actively participated in the <a href="Protests%20of%201968">late sixties students and workers revolts</a>. In 1968 in <a href="Carrara">Carrara</a>, Italy the <a href="International%20of%20Anarchist%20Federations">International of Anarchist Federations</a> was founded during an international anarchist conference held there in 1968 by the three existing European federations of France (the <a href="F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20anarchiste">Fédération Anarchiste</a>), the <a href="Federazione%20Anarchica%20Italiana">Federazione Anarchica Italiana</a> of Italy and the <a href="Iberian%20Anarchist%20Federation">Iberian Anarchist Federation</a> as well as the <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgarian</a> federation in French exile.

In the United Kingdom in the 1970s this was associated with the <a href="punk%20rock">punk rock</a> movement, as exemplified by bands such as <a href="Crass">Crass</a> and the <a href="Sex%20Pistols">Sex Pistols</a>. The housing and employment crisis in most of Western Europe led to the formation of <a href="commune%20%28intentional%20community%29">communes</a> and <a href="Squatting">squatter</a> movements like that of <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, Spain. In Denmark, <a href="squatter">squatters</a> occupied a disused military base and declared the <a href="Freetown%20Christiania">Freetown Christiania</a>, an autonomous haven in central Copenhagen. Since the revival of anarchism in the mid-20th century, a number of new movements and schools of thought emerged. Although feminist tendencies have always been a part of the anarchist movement in the form of <a href="anarcha-feminism">anarcha-feminism</a>, they returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism in the 1960s. Anarchist anthropologist <a href="David%20Graeber">David Graeber</a> and anarchist historian <a href="Andrej%20Grubacic">Andrej Grubacic</a> have posited a rupture between generations of anarchism, with those "who often still have not shaken the sectarian habits" of the 19th century contrasted with the younger activists who are "much more informed, among other elements, by <a href="Traditional%20knowledge">indigenous</a>, <a href="feminism">feminist</a>, ecological and <a href="counterculture">cultural-critical</a> ideas", and who by the turn of the 21st century formed "by far the majority" of anarchists.

Around the turn of the 21st century, anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti-war, anti-capitalist, and <a href="anti-globalisation%20movement">anti-globalisation movements</a>. Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the <a href="World%20Trade%20Organization">World Trade Organization</a> (WTO), <a href="G8">Group of Eight</a>, and the <a href="World%20Economic%20Forum">World Economic Forum</a>. Some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting, property destruction, and violent confrontations with police. These actions were precipitated by ad hoc, leaderless, anonymous cadres known as "<a href="black%20bloc">black blocs</a>"; other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include <a href="security%20culture">security culture</a>, <a href="affinity%20groups">affinity groups</a> and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet. A significant event of this period was the confrontations at <a href="World%20Trade%20Organization%20Ministerial%20Conference%20of%201999%20protest%20activity">WTO conference in Seattle in 1999</a>. According to anarchist scholar <a href="Simon%20Critchley">Simon Critchley</a>, "contemporary anarchism can be seen as a powerful critique of the pseudo-libertarianism of contemporary <a href="neo-liberalism">neo-liberalism</a> ... One might say that contemporary anarchism is about responsibility, whether sexual, ecological or socio-economic; it flows from an experience of conscience about the manifold ways in which the West ravages the rest; it is an ethical outrage at the yawning inequality, impoverishment and disenfranchisment that is so palpable locally and globally."

International anarchist federations in existence include the <a href="International%20of%20Anarchist%20Federations">International of Anarchist Federations</a>, the <a href="International%20Workers%27%20Association">International Workers' Association</a>, and <a href="International%20Libertarian%20Solidarity">International Libertarian Solidarity</a>.
The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the <a href="Confederaci%C3%B3n%20General%20del%20Trabajo">Confederación General del Trabajo</a> (CGT) and the <a href="Confederaci%C3%B3n%20Nacional%20del%20Trabajo">CNT</a>. CGT membership was estimated at around 100,000 for 2003. Other active syndicalist movements include in Sweden the <a href="Central%20Organisation%20of%20the%20Workers%20of%20Sweden">Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden</a> and the <a href="Swedish%20Anarcho-syndicalist%20Youth%20Federation">Swedish Anarcho-syndicalist Youth Federation</a>; the CNT-AIT in France; the <a href="Unione%20Sindacale%20Italiana">Unione Sindicale Italiana</a> in Italy; in the US <a href="Workers%20Solidarity%20Alliance">Workers Solidarity Alliance</a> and the UK <a href="Solidarity%20Federation">Solidarity Federation</a> and <a href="Anarchist%20Federation%20%28Britain%20and%20Ireland%29">Anarchist Federation</a>. The revolutionary industrial unionist <a href="Industrial%20Workers%20of%20the%20World">Industrial Workers of the World</a>, claiming 3,000 paying members, and the <a href="International%20Workers%20Association">International Workers Association</a>, an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the First International, also remain active.

Anarchist schools of thought had been generally grouped in two main historical traditions, <a href="individualist%20anarchism">individualist anarchism</a> and <a href="social%20anarchism">social anarchism</a>, which have some different origins, values and evolution. The individualist wing of anarchism emphasises <a href="negative%20liberty">negative liberty</a>, i.e. opposition to state or <a href="social%20control">social control</a> over the individual, while those in the social wing emphasise <a href="positive%20liberty">positive liberty</a> to achieve one's potential and argue that humans have needs that society ought to fulfil, "recognizing equality of entitlement". In a chronological and theoretical sense, there are classical – those created throughout the 19th century – and post-classical anarchist schools – those created since the mid-20th century and after.

Beyond the specific factions of anarchist thought is <a href="philosophical%20anarchism">philosophical anarchism</a>, which embodies the theoretical stance that the <a href="state%20%28polity%29">state</a> lacks moral legitimacy without accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it. A component especially of individualist anarchism philosophical anarchism may accept the existence of a <a href="minarchism">minimal state</a> as unfortunate, and usually temporary, "necessary evil" but argue that citizens do not have a <a href="moral%20obligation">moral obligation</a> to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy. One reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was "<a href="anarchism%20without%20adjectives">anarchism without adjectives</a>", a call for <a href="toleration">toleration</a> first adopted by <a href="Fernando%20Tarrida%20del%20M%C3%A1rmol">Fernando Tarrida del Mármol</a> in 1889 in response to the "bitter debates" of anarchist theory at the time. In abandoning the hyphenated anarchisms (i.e. collectivist-, communist-, mutualist– and individualist-anarchism), it sought to emphasise the <a href="anti-authoritarian">anti-authoritarian</a> beliefs common to all anarchist schools of thought.

Mutualism began in 18th-century English and French labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with <a href="Pierre-Joseph%20Proudhon">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a> in France and others in the United States. Proudhon proposed <a href="spontaneous%20order">spontaneous order</a>, whereby organisation emerges without central authority, a "positive anarchy" where order arises when everybody does "what he wishes and only what he wishes" and where "business transactions alone produce the social order." It is important to recognize that Proudhon distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance. For this reason, much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous self-governance, Proudhon was heavily involved in French parliamentary politics and allied himself not with Anarchist but Socialist factions of workers movements and, in addition to advocating state-protected charters for worker-owned cooperatives, promoted certain nationalisation schemes during his life of public service.

Mutualist anarchism is concerned with <a href="Reciprocity%20%28cultural%20anthropology%29">reciprocity</a>, free association, voluntary contract, federation, and credit and currency reform. According to the American mutualist <a href="William%20Batchelder%20Greene">William Batchelder Greene</a>, each worker in the mutualist system would receive "just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount." Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism. Proudhon first characterised his goal as a "third form of society, the synthesis of communism and property."

Individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasize the <a href="individual">individual</a> and their <a href="will%20%28philosophy%29">will</a> over any kinds of external determinants such as groups, society, traditions, and ideological systems. Individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy but refers to a group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict.

In 1793, <a href="William%20Godwin">William Godwin</a>, who has often been cited as the first anarchist, wrote "<a href="Political%20Justice">Political Justice</a>", which some consider the first expression of anarchism. Godwin, a philosophical anarchist, from a <a href="rationalist">rationalist</a> and <a href="utilitarian">utilitarian</a> basis opposed revolutionary action and saw a <a href="Limited%20government">minimal state</a> as a present "necessary evil" that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge. Godwin advocated <a href="individualism">individualism</a>, proposing that all cooperation in labour be eliminated on the premise that this would be most conducive with the general good.

An influential form of individualist anarchism, called "egoism," or <a href="egoist%20anarchism">egoist anarchism</a>, was expounded by one of the earliest and best-known proponents of individualist anarchism, the German <a href="Max%20Stirner">Max Stirner</a>. Stirner's "<a href="The%20Ego%20and%20Its%20Own">The Ego and Its Own</a>", published in 1844, is a founding text of the philosophy. According to Stirner, the only limitation on the rights of individuals is their power to obtain what they desire, without regard for God, state, or morality. To Stirner, rights were "<a href="Reification%20%28fallacy%29">spooks</a>" in the mind, and he held that society does not exist but "the individuals are its reality". Stirner advocated self-assertion and foresaw <a href="union%20of%20egoists">unions of egoists</a>, non-systematic associations continually renewed by all parties' support through an act of will, which Stirner proposed as a form of organisation in place of the <a href="state%20%28polity%29">state</a>. Egoist anarchists argue that egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between individuals. "Egoism" has inspired many interpretations of Stirner's philosophy. It was re-discovered and promoted by German philosophical anarchist and <a href="LGBT">LGBT</a> activist <a href="John%20Henry%20Mackay">John Henry Mackay</a>.

<a href="Josiah%20Warren">Josiah Warren</a> is widely regarded as the first American anarchist, and the four-page weekly paper he edited during 1833, "The Peaceful Revolutionist", was the first anarchist periodical published. For American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster "It is apparent ... that <a href="Pierre-Joseph%20Proudhon">Proudhonian</a> Anarchism was to be found in the United States at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the Individualist Anarchism of <a href="Josiah%20Warren">Josiah Warren</a> and <a href="Stephen%20Pearl%20Andrews">Stephen Pearl Andrews</a> ... <a href="William%20B.%20Greene">William B. Greene</a> presented this Proudhonian Mutualism in its purest and most systematic form.". <a href="Henry%20David%20Thoreau">Henry David Thoreau</a> (1817–1862) was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the United States and Europe. Thoreau was an American author, poet, naturalist, tax resister, <a href="Development%20criticism">development critic</a>, surveyor, historian, philosopher, and leading <a href="transcendentalist">transcendentalist</a>. He is best known for his books "<a href="Walden">Walden</a>", a reflection upon <a href="simple%20living">simple living</a> in natural surroundings, and his essay, "<a href="Civil%20Disobedience%20%28Thoreau%29">Civil Disobedience</a>", an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. Later <a href="Benjamin%20Tucker">Benjamin Tucker</a> fused Stirner's egoism with the economics of Warren and Proudhon in his eclectic influential publication "<a href="Liberty%20%281881%E2%80%931908%29">Liberty</a>".

From these early influences individualist anarchism in different countries attracted a small but diverse following of bohemian artists and intellectuals, <a href="free%20love">free love</a> and <a href="birth%20control">birth control</a> advocates (see <a href="Anarchism%20and%20issues%20related%20to%20love%20and%20sex">Anarchism and issues related to love and sex</a>), individualist <a href="Naturism">naturists</a> <a href="Nudism">nudists</a> (see <a href="anarcho-naturism">anarcho-naturism</a>), <a href="freethought">freethought</a> and <a href="Anti-clericalism">anti-clerical</a> activists as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as <a href="illegalism">illegalism</a> and <a href="individual%20reclamation">individual reclamation</a> (see <a href="European%20individualist%20anarchism">European individualist anarchism</a> and <a href="individualist%20anarchism%20in%20France">individualist anarchism in France</a>). These authors and activists included <a href="Oscar%20Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a>, <a href="Emile%20Armand">Emile Armand</a>, <a href="Han%20Ryner">Han Ryner</a>, <a href="Henri%20Zisly">Henri Zisly</a>, <a href="Renzo%20Novatore">Renzo Novatore</a>, <a href="Miguel%20Gimenez%20Igualada">Miguel Gimenez Igualada</a>, <a href="Adolf%20Brand">Adolf Brand</a> and <a href="Lev%20Chernyi">Lev Chernyi</a> among others.

Social anarchism calls for a system with common ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organisations, without any government authority or <a href="coercion">coercion</a>. It is the largest school of thought in anarchism. Social anarchism rejects private property, seeing it as a source of social inequality (while retaining respect for <a href="personal%20property">personal property</a>), and emphasises cooperation and <a href="mutual%20aid%20%28organization%29">mutual aid</a>.

Collectivist anarchism, also referred to as "revolutionary socialism" or a form of such, is a revolutionary form of anarchism, commonly associated with <a href="Mikhail%20Bakunin">Mikhail Bakunin</a> and <a href="Johann%20Most">Johann Most</a>. Collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production, instead advocating that ownership be collectivised. This was to be achieved through violent revolution, first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of violence, or "<a href="propaganda%20by%20the%20deed">propaganda by the deed</a>", which would inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivise the means of production.

However, collectivisation was not to be extended to the distribution of income, as workers would be paid according to time worked, rather than receiving goods being distributed "according to need" as in anarcho-communism. This position was criticised by <a href="anarchist%20communists">anarchist communists</a> as effectively "uphold[ing] the wages system". Collectivist anarchism arose contemporaneously with <a href="Marxism">Marxism</a> but opposed the Marxist <a href="dictatorship%20of%20the%20proletariat">dictatorship of the proletariat</a>, despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society. Anarchist, communist and collectivist ideas are not <a href="mutually%20exclusive">mutually exclusive</a>; although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labour, some held out the possibility of a post-revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need.

Anarchist communism (also known as anarcho-communism, libertarian communism and occasionally as free communism) is a theory of anarchism that advocates abolition of the <a href="State%20%28polity%29">state</a>, <a href="market%20%28economics%29">markets</a>, money, <a href="private%20property">private property</a> (while retaining respect for <a href="personal%20property">personal property</a>), and capitalism in favour of <a href="common%20ownership">common ownership</a> of the <a href="means%20of%20production">means of production</a>, <a href="direct%20democracy">direct democracy</a> and a horizontal network of <a href="voluntary%20association">voluntary associations</a> and <a href="workers%27%20council">workers' councils</a> with production and consumption based on the guiding principle: "<a href="from%20each%20according%20to%20his%20ability%2C%20to%20each%20according%20to%20his%20need">from each according to his ability, to each according to his need</a>".

Some forms of anarchist communism such as <a href="insurrectionary%20anarchism">insurrectionary anarchism</a> are strongly influenced by <a href="egoist%20anarchism">egoism</a> and radical <a href="individualism">individualism</a>, believing anarcho-communism is the best social system for the realisation of individual freedom. Most anarcho-communists view anarcho-communism as a way of reconciling the opposition between the individual and society.

Anarcho-communism developed out of radical socialist currents after the French revolution but was first formulated as such in the Italian section of the <a href="First%20International">First International</a>. The theoretical work of <a href="Peter%20Kropotkin">Peter Kropotkin</a> took importance later as it expanded and developed pro-organisationalist and <a href="Insurrectionary%20anarchism">insurrectionary anti-organisationalist</a> sections. To date, the best known examples of an anarchist communist society (i.e., established around the ideas as they exist today and achieving worldwide attention and knowledge in the historical canon), are the anarchist territories during the <a href="Spanish%20Revolution">Spanish Revolution</a> and the <a href="Free%20Territory">Free Territory</a> during the <a href="Russian%20Revolution%20%281917%29">Russian Revolution</a>. Through the efforts and influence of the <a href="Spanish%20Anarchists">Spanish Anarchists</a> during the <a href="Spanish%20Revolution">Spanish Revolution</a> within the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>, starting in 1936 anarchist communism existed in most of <a href="Anarchist%20Aragon">Aragon</a>, parts of the Levante and Andalusia, as well as in the stronghold of <a href="Anarchist%20Catalonia">Anarchist Catalonia</a> before being crushed by the combined forces of <a href="Francoism">the regime that won the war</a>, <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Hitler</a>, Mussolini, Spanish Communist Party repression (backed by the USSR) as well as economic and armaments blockades from the capitalist countries and the Spanish Republic itself. During the Russian Revolution, anarchists such as <a href="Nestor%20Makhno">Nestor Makhno</a> worked to create and defend – through the <a href="Revolutionary%20Insurrectionary%20Army%20of%20Ukraine">Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine</a> – anarchist communism in the <a href="Free%20Territory">Free Territory</a> of the Ukraine from 1919 before being conquered by the Bolsheviks in 1921.

Anarcho-syndicalism is a branch of anarchism that focuses on the <a href="trade%20union">labour movement</a>. Anarcho-syndicalists view <a href="trade%20union">labour unions</a> as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the <a href="State%20%28polity%29">state</a> with a new society democratically self-managed by workers. The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are: Workers' <a href="wikt%3ASolidarity">solidarity</a>, <a href="Direct%20action">Direct action</a> and <a href="Workers%27%20self-management">Workers' self-management</a>
Anarcho-syndicalists believe that only <a href="direct%20action">direct action</a> – that is, action concentrated on directly attaining a goal, as opposed to indirect action, such as electing a representative to a government position – will allow workers to liberate themselves. Moreover, anarcho-syndicalists believe that workers' organisations (the organisations that struggle against the wage system, which, in anarcho-syndicalist theory, will eventually form the basis of a new society) should be self-managing. They should not have bosses or "business agents"; rather, the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves. <a href="Rudolf%20Rocker">Rudolf Rocker</a> was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho-syndicalist movement. He outlined a view of the origins of the movement, what it sought, and why it was important to the future of labour in his 1938 pamphlet "Anarcho-Syndicalism". The <a href="International%20Workers%20Association">International Workers Association</a> is an international anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labour unions from different countries. The Spanish <a href="Confederaci%C3%B3n%20Nacional%20del%20Trabajo">Confederación Nacional del Trabajo</a> played and still plays a major role in the Spanish <a href="labour%20movement">labour movement</a>. It was also an important force in the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>.

The term syncretic anarchism was first coined by <a href="Alberto%20Frigo">Alberto Frigo</a> in relation to his reading of Jacques Ellul. Rephrasing the latter, Frigo observed that, if on one hand new technologies creates new form of power, on the other, new technologies are accompanied by the rise of what <a href="Marcel%20Mauss">Marcel Mauss</a> defines as magic. By developing the techniques to perform new magic and by adhering to it, marginal individuals come to create forms of syncretism which brings together the different dogmas and cultures a power structures uses to put humans against one another. The 19th century French postman <a href="Ferdinand%20Cheval">Ferdinand Cheval</a> for example, has intuitively experimented with the, at that time, new medium of cement and created a after 33 years of adherence to certain rituals, a monument blending religions from around the world.

Anarchism continues to generate many philosophies and movements, at times eclectic, drawing upon various sources, and <a href="Syncretic%20politics">syncretic</a>, combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches.

<a href="Green%20anarchism">Green anarchism</a> (or eco-anarchism) is a school of thought within anarchism that emphasises environmental issues, with an important precedent in <a href="anarcho-naturism">anarcho-naturism</a>, and whose main contemporary currents are <a href="anarcho-primitivism">anarcho-primitivism</a> and <a href="social%20ecology">social ecology</a>.

<a href="Anarcha-feminism">Anarcha-feminism</a> (also called anarchist feminism and anarcho-feminism) combines anarchism with <a href="feminism">feminism</a>. It generally views <a href="patriarchy">patriarchy</a> as a manifestation of involuntary <a href="Coercion">coercive</a> hierarchy that should be replaced by <a href="decentralised">decentralised</a> <a href="Free%20association%20%28communism%20and%20anarchism%29">free association</a>. Anarcha-feminists believe that the struggle against patriarchy is an essential part of <a href="class%20struggle">class struggle</a>, and the anarchist struggle against the <a href="State%20%28polity%29">state</a>. In essence, the philosophy sees anarchist struggle as a necessary component of feminist struggle and vice versa. <a href="L.%20Susan%20Brown">L. Susan Brown</a> claims that "as anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes all relationships of power, it is inherently feminist". Anarcha-feminism began with the late 19th-century writings of early feminist anarchists such as <a href="Emma%20Goldman">Emma Goldman</a> and <a href="Voltairine%20de%20Cleyre">Voltairine de Cleyre</a>.

<a href="Anarcho-pacifism">Anarcho-pacifism</a> is a tendency that rejects violence in the struggle for social change (see <a href="non-violence">non-violence</a>). It developed "mostly in the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, Britain, and the United States, before and during the Second World War". <a href="Christian%20anarchism">Christian anarchism</a> is a <a href="Christian%20movement">movement</a> in <a href="political%20theology">political theology</a> that combines anarchism and Christianity. Its main proponents included <a href="Leo%20Tolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</a>, <a href="Dorothy%20Day">Dorothy Day</a>, <a href="Ammon%20Hennacy">Ammon Hennacy</a>, and <a href="Jacques%20Ellul">Jacques Ellul</a>.

<a href="Platformism">Platformism</a> is a tendency within the wider anarchist movement based on the organisational theories in the tradition of <a href="Dielo%20Truda">Dielo Truda</a>'s "Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)". The document was based on the experiences of <a href="Anarchism%20in%20Russia">Russian anarchists</a> in the 1917 <a href="October%20Revolution">October Revolution</a>, which led eventually to the victory of the <a href="Bolsheviks">Bolsheviks</a> over the anarchists and other groups. The "Platform" attempted to address and explain the anarchist movement's failures during the <a href="Russian%20Revolution%20%281917%29">Russian Revolution</a>.

<a href="Synthesis%20anarchism">Synthesis anarchism</a> is a form of anarchism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of <a href="anarchism%20without%20adjectives">anarchism without adjectives</a>. In the 1920s, this form found as its main proponents the <a href="anarcho-communists">anarcho-communists</a> <a href="Voline">Voline</a> and <a href="S%C3%A9bastien%20Faure">Sébastien Faure</a>. It is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global <a href="International%20of%20Anarchist%20Federations">International of Anarchist Federations</a>.

<a href="Post-left%20anarchy">Post-left anarchy</a> is a recent current in anarchist thought that promotes a critique of anarchism's relationship to traditional <a href="Left-wing%20politics">Left-wing politics</a>. Some post-leftists seek to escape the confines of <a href="ideology">ideology</a> in general also presenting a critique of organisations and <a href="morality">morality</a>. Influenced by the work of <a href="Max%20Stirner">Max Stirner</a> and by the Marxist <a href="Situationist%20International">Situationist International</a>, post-left anarchy is marked by a focus on social <a href="insurrectionary%20anarchism">insurrection</a> and a rejection of leftist social organisation.

<a href="Insurrectionary%20anarchism">Insurrectionary anarchism</a> is a revolutionary theory, practice, and tendency within the anarchist movement which emphasises <a href="insurrection">insurrection</a> within anarchist practice. It is critical of formal organisations such as <a href="labour%20unions">labour unions</a> and federations that are based on a political programme and periodic congresses. Instead, insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organisation and small <a href="affinity%20group">affinity group</a> based organisation. Insurrectionary anarchists put value in attack, permanent <a href="class%20conflict">class conflict</a>, and a refusal to negotiate or compromise with class enemies.

<a href="Post-anarchism">Post-anarchism</a> is a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and <a href="poststructuralist">poststructuralist</a> thought, drawing from diverse ideas including <a href="post-modernism">post-modernism</a>, <a href="autonomist%20marxism">autonomist marxism</a>, <a href="post-left%20anarchy">post-left anarchy</a>, <a href="Situationist%20International">Situationist International</a>, and <a href="postcolonialism">postcolonialism</a>.

<a href="Left-wing%20market%20anarchism">Left-wing market anarchism</a> strongly affirm the classical liberal ideas of self-ownership and free markets, while maintaining that, taken to their logical conclusions, these ideas support strongly anti-corporatist, anti-hierarchical, pro-labor positions and anti-capitalism in economics and anti-imperialism in foreign policy.

<a href="Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> advocates the elimination of the <a href="state%20%28polity%29">state</a> in favour of <a href="sovereign%20individual">individual sovereignty</a> in a <a href="free%20market">free market</a>. Anarcho-capitalism developed from radical anti-state <a href="libertarianism">libertarianism</a> and <a href="individualist%20anarchism">individualist anarchism</a>, drawing from <a href="Austrian%20School">Austrian School</a> economics, study of <a href="law%20and%20economics">law and economics</a>, and <a href="public%20choice%20theory">public choice theory</a>. There is a strong current within anarchism which does not consider that anarcho-capitalism can be considered a part of the anarchist movement due to the fact that anarchism has historically been an <a href="anti-capitalist">anti-capitalist</a> movement and for definitional reasons which see anarchism <a href="Anarchism%20and%20capitalism">incompatible</a> with capitalist forms.

Anarchism is a <a href="philosophy">philosophy</a> that embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies and schools of thought; as such, disagreement over questions of values, ideology and tactics is common. The compatibility of <a href="anarchism%20and%20capitalism">capitalism</a>, <a href="anarchism%20and%20nationalism">nationalism</a>, and <a href="anarchism%20and%20religion">religion</a> with anarchism is widely disputed. Similarly, anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as <a href="Anarchism%20and%20Marxism">Marxism</a>, <a href="Issues%20in%20anarchism%23Communism">communism</a> and <a href="Anarchism%20and%20capitalism">capitalism</a>. Anarchists may be motivated by <a href="humanism">humanism</a>, <a href="Christian%20anarchism">divine authority</a>, <a href="enlightened%20self-interest">enlightened self-interest</a>, <a href="veganarchism">veganism</a> or any number of alternative ethical doctrines.

Phenomena such as <a href="civilisation">civilisation</a>, <a href="technology">technology</a> (e.g. within <a href="anarcho-primitivism">anarcho-primitivism</a>), and <a href="Issues%20in%20anarchism%23Participation%20in%20statist%20democracy">the democratic process</a> may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others.

On a tactical level, while <a href="propaganda%20of%20the%20deed">propaganda of the deed</a> was a tactic used by anarchists in the 19th century (e.g. the <a href="Nihilist%20movement">Nihilist movement</a>), some contemporary anarchists espouse alternative <a href="direct%20action">direct action</a> methods such as <a href="nonviolence">nonviolence</a>, <a href="counter-economics">counter-economics</a> and <a href="Crypto-anarchism">anti-state cryptography</a> to bring about an anarchist society. About the scope of an anarchist society, some anarchists advocate a global one, while others do so by local ones. The diversity in anarchism has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions, which has led to many <a href="definitional%20concerns%20in%20anarchist%20theory">definitional concerns in anarchist theory</a>.
Intersecting and overlapping between various schools of thought, certain topics of interest and internal disputes have proven perennial within anarchist theory.

An important current within anarchism is <a href="free%20love">free love</a>. Free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to <a href="Josiah%20Warren">Josiah Warren</a> and to experimental communities, viewed sexual freedom as a clear, direct expression of an individual's sovereignty. Free love particularly stressed <a href="women%27s%20rights">women's rights</a> since most sexual laws discriminated against women: for example, marriage laws and anti-birth control measures. The most important American free love journal was "<a href="Lucifer%20the%20Lightbearer">Lucifer the Lightbearer</a>" (1883–1907) edited by <a href="Moses%20Harman">Moses Harman</a> and <a href="Lois%20Waisbrooker">Lois Waisbrooker</a>, but also there existed <a href="Ezra%20Heywood">Ezra Heywood</a> and Angela Heywood's "<a href="The%20Word%20%28free%20love%29">The Word</a>" (1872–1890, 1892–1893). "<a href="Free%20Society">Free Society</a>" (1895–1897 as "The Firebrand"; 1897–1904 as "Free Society") was a major anarchist newspaper in the United States at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries. The publication advocated <a href="free%20love">free love</a> and <a href="women%27s%20rights">women's rights</a>, and critiqued "<a href="Comstockery">Comstockery</a>" – censorship of sexual information. Also <a href="M.%20E.%20Lazarus">M. E. Lazarus</a> was an important American individualist anarchist who promoted free love.

In New York City's <a href="Greenwich%20Village">Greenwich Village</a>, <a href="Bohemianism">bohemian</a> feminists and socialists advocated self-realisation and pleasure for women (and also men) in the here and now. They encouraged playing with sexual roles and sexuality, and the openly bisexual radical <a href="Edna%20St.%20Vincent%20Millay">Edna St. Vincent Millay</a> and the lesbian anarchist <a href="Margaret%20Anderson">Margaret Anderson</a> were prominent among them. Discussion groups organised by the Villagers were frequented by <a href="Emma%20Goldman">Emma Goldman</a>, among others. Magnus Hirschfeld noted in 1923 that Goldman "has campaigned boldly and steadfastly for individual rights, and especially for those deprived of their rights. Thus it came about that she was the first and only woman, indeed the first and only American, to take up the defense of homosexual love before the general public." In fact, before Goldman, <a href="heterosexual">heterosexual</a> anarchist Robert Reitzel (1849–1898) spoke positively of homosexuality from the beginning of the 1890s in his Detroit-based <a href="German%20language">German language</a> journal "Der arme Teufel" (English: The Poor Devil). In Argentina anarcha-feminist <a href="Virginia%20Bolten">Virginia Bolten</a> published the newspaper called "" (English: The Woman's Voice), which was published nine times in Rosario between 8 January 1896 and 1 January 1897, and was revived, briefly, in 1901.

In Europe the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was <a href="Emile%20Armand">Emile Armand</a>. He proposed the concept of "la camaraderie amoureuse" to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults. He was also a consistent proponent of <a href="polyamory">polyamory</a>. In Germany the <a href="stirner">stirnerists</a> <a href="Adolf%20Brand">Adolf Brand</a> and <a href="John%20Henry%20Mackay">John Henry Mackay</a> were pioneering campaigners for the acceptance of male <a href="bisexuality">bisexuality</a> and <a href="homosexuality">homosexuality</a>. <a href="Mujeres%20Libres">Mujeres Libres</a> was an anarchist women's organisation in Spain that aimed to empower working class women. It was founded in 1936 by <a href="Luc%C3%ADa%20S%C3%A1nchez%20Saornil">Lucía Sánchez Saornil</a>, Mercedes Comaposada and <a href="Amparo%20Poch%20y%20Gasc%C3%B3n">Amparo Poch y Gascón</a> and had approximately 30,000 members. The organisation was based on the idea of a "double struggle" for <a href="Feminist%20movement">women's liberation</a> and <a href="social%20revolution">social revolution</a> and argued that the two objectives were equally important and should be pursued in parallel. In order to gain mutual support, they created networks of women anarchists. <a href="Luc%C3%ADa%20S%C3%A1nchez%20Saornil">Lucía Sánchez Saornil</a> was a main founder of the Spanish <a href="anarcha-feminist">anarcha-feminist</a> federation <a href="Mujeres%20Libres">Mujeres Libres</a> who was open about her <a href="lesbian">lesbianism</a>. She was published in a variety of literary journals where working under a male pen name, she was able to explore <a href="lesbian">lesbian</a> themes at a time when homosexuality was criminalised and subject to <a href="censorship">censorship</a> and punishment.

More recently, the British <a href="anarcho-pacifist">anarcho-pacifist</a> <a href="Alex%20Comfort">Alex Comfort</a> gained notoriety during the <a href="sexual%20revolution">sexual revolution</a> for writing the bestseller sex manual "<a href="The%20Joy%20of%20Sex">The Joy of Sex</a>". The issue of <a href="free%20love">free love</a> has a dedicated treatment in the work of French anarcho-<a href="hedonist">hedonist</a> philosopher <a href="Michel%20Onfray">Michel Onfray</a> in such works as "Théorie du corps amoureux : pour une érotique solaire" (2000) and "L'invention du plaisir : fragments cyréaniques" (2002).

 For English anarchist <a href="William%20Godwin">William Godwin</a> education was "the main means by which change would be achieved." Godwin saw that the main goal of education should be the promotion of happiness. For Godwin education had to have "A respect for the child's autonomy which precluded any form of coercion," "A pedagogy that respected this and sought to build on the child's own motivation and initiatives," and "A concern about the child's capacity to resist an ideology transmitted through the school." In his "<a href="Political%20Justice">Political Justice</a>" he criticises state sponsored schooling "on account of its obvious alliance with national government". Early American anarchist <a href="Josiah%20Warren">Josiah Warren</a> advanced alternative education experiences in the libertarian communities he established. <a href="Max%20Stirner">Max Stirner</a> wrote in 1842 a long essay on education called "<a href="The%20False%20Principle%20of%20our%20Education">The False Principle of our Education</a>". In it Stirner names his educational principle "personalist," explaining that self-understanding consists in hourly self-creation. Education for him is to create "free men, sovereign characters," by which he means "eternal characters ... who are therefore eternal because they form themselves each moment".

In the United States "freethought was a basically <a href="Anti-Christianity">anti-christian</a>, <a href="anti-clerical">anti-clerical</a> movement, whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters. A number of contributors to "<a href="Liberty%20%281881%E2%80%931908%29">Liberty</a>" (anarchist publication) were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism. The individualist anarchist George MacDonald was a co-editor of "Freethought" and, for a time, "The Truth Seeker". E.C. Walker was co-editor of the excellent free-thought / free love journal "<a href="Lucifer%2C%20the%20Light-Bearer">Lucifer, the Light-Bearer</a>"". "Many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers; reprints from freethought papers such as "<a href="Lucifer%2C%20the%20Light-Bearer">Lucifer, the Light-Bearer</a>", "Freethought" and "The Truth Seeker" appeared in "<a href="Liberty%20%281881%E2%80%931908%29">Liberty</a>"... The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself".

In 1901, Catalan anarchist and <a href="Freethought">free-thinker</a> <a href="Francesc%20Ferrer%20i%20Gu%C3%A0rdia">Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia</a> established "modern" or <a href="Progressive%20education">progressive schools</a> in <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a> in defiance of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church. The schools' stated goal was to "<a href="Popular%20education">educate the working class</a> in a rational, secular and non-coercive setting". Fiercely anti-clerical, Ferrer believed in "freedom in education", education free from the authority of church and state. <a href="Murray%20Bookchin">Murray Bookchin</a> wrote: "This period [1890s] was the heyday of libertarian schools and pedagogical projects in all areas of the country where Anarchists exercised some degree of influence. Perhaps the best-known effort in this field was Francisco Ferrer's Modern School (Escuela Moderna), a project which exercised a considerable influence on Catalan education and on experimental techniques of teaching generally." La Escuela Moderna, and Ferrer's ideas generally, formed the inspiration for a series of "<a href="Modern%20School%20%28United%20States%29">Modern Schools</a>" in the United States, <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a>, South America and London. The first of these was started in New York City in 1911. It also inspired the Italian newspaper "<a href="Universit%C3%A0%20popolare%20%28Italian%20newspaper%29">Università popolare</a>", founded in 1901. Russian <a href="christian%20anarchist">christian anarchist</a> <a href="Leo%20Tolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</a> established a school for peasant children on his estate. Tolstoy's educational experiments were short-lived due to harassment by the Tsarist secret police. Tolstoy established a conceptual difference between education and culture. He thought that "Education is the tendency of one man to make another just like himself ... Education is culture under restraint, culture is free. [Education is] when the teaching is forced upon the pupil, and when then instruction is exclusive, that is when only those subjects are taught which the educator regards as necessary". For him "without compulsion, education was transformed into culture".

A more recent libertarian tradition on education is that of <a href="unschooling">unschooling</a> and the <a href="anarchist%20free%20school">free school</a> in which child-led activity replaces pedagogic approaches. Experiments in Germany led to <a href="A.%20S.%20Neill">A. S. Neill</a> founding what became <a href="Summerhill%20School">Summerhill School</a> in 1921. Summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice. However, although Summerhill and other free schools are radically libertarian, they differ in principle from those of Ferrer by not advocating an overtly political <a href="class%20struggle">class struggle</a>-approach.
In addition to organising schools according to libertarian principles, anarchists have also questioned the concept of schooling per se. The term <a href="deschooling">deschooling</a> was popularised by <a href="Ivan%20Illich">Ivan Illich</a>, who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self-determined learning and serves the creation of a consumer society instead.

Criticisms of anarchism include <a href="morality">moral</a> criticisms and pragmatic criticisms. Anarchism is often evaluated as unfeasible or <a href="utopian">utopian</a> by its critics. European history professor Carl Landauer, in his book "European Socialism" argued that social anarchism is unrealistic and that government is a "lesser evil" than a society without "repressive force." He also argued that "ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears" is an "absurdity."

Autism

Autism is a <a href="neurodevelopmental%20disorder">neurodevelopmental disorder</a> characterized by impaired <a href="Interpersonal%20relationship">social interaction</a>, <a href="language%20acquisition">verbal</a> and <a href="non-verbal%20communication">non-verbal communication</a>, and restricted and repetitive behavior. Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child's life. These signs often develop gradually, though some children with autism reach their <a href="developmental%20milestones">developmental milestones</a> at a normal pace and then <a href="Regressive%20autism">regress</a>. The <a href="Diagnostic%20and%20Statistical%20Manual%20of%20Mental%20Disorders">diagnostic criteria</a> require that symptoms become apparent in early childhood, typically before age three.
While autism is highly heritable, researchers suspect both environmental and genetic factors as causes. In rare cases, autism is strongly associated with <a href="Teratology">agents that cause birth defects</a>. <a href="Controversies%20in%20autism">Controversies</a> surround other proposed environmental <a href="Causes%20of%20autism">causes</a>; for example, the <a href="MMR%20vaccine%20controversy">vaccine hypotheses</a>, which have since been disproven. Autism affects information processing in the <a href="Human%20brain">brain</a> by altering how <a href="nerve%20cell">nerve cells</a> and their <a href="synapse">synapses</a> connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood. In the <a href="DSM%20V">DSM V</a> it is one of three recognized disorders in the <a href="autism%20spectrum">autism spectrum</a> (ASDs), the other two being <a href="Asperger%20syndrome">Asperger syndrome</a>, which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and <a href="PDD-NOS">pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified</a> (commonly abbreviated as PDD-NOS), which is diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome are not met.
Early speech or <a href="Early%20intensive%20behavioral%20intervention">behavioral interventions</a> can help children with autism gain self-care, social, and communication skills. Although there is no known cure, there have been reported cases of children who recovered. Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, though some become successful. An <a href="Sociological%20and%20cultural%20aspects%20of%20autism">autistic culture</a> has developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be <a href="Autism%20rights%20movement">accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder</a>.
Globally, autism is estimated to affect 21.7 million people as of 2013. As of 2010, the number of people affected is estimated at about 1–2 per 1,000 worldwide. It occurs four to five times more often in boys than girls. About 1.5% of children in the United States (one in 68) are diagnosed with ASD , a 30% increase from one in 88 in 2012. The rate of autism among adults aged 18 years and over in the United Kingdom is 1.1%. The number of people diagnosed has been increasing dramatically since the 1980s, partly due to changes in diagnostic practice and government-subsidized financial incentives for named diagnoses; the question of whether actual rates have increased is unresolved.

Autism is a highly variable <a href="neurodevelopmental%20disorder">neurodevelopmental disorder</a> that first appears during infancy or childhood, and generally follows a steady course without <a href="Remission%20%28medicine%29">remission</a>. People with autism may be severely impaired in some respects but normal, or even superior, in others. Overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months, become established by age two or three years, and tend to continue through adulthood, although often in more muted form. It is distinguished not by a single symptom, but by a characteristic triad of symptoms: impairments in social interaction; impairments in communication; and restricted interests and repetitive behavior. Other aspects, such as atypical eating, are also common but are not essential for diagnosis. Autism's individual symptoms occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly, without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits.

Social deficits distinguish autism and the related <a href="autism%20spectrum%20disorder">autism spectrum disorders</a> (ASD; see <a href="%23Classification">Classification</a>) from other developmental disorders. People with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted. Noted autistic <a href="Temple%20Grandin">Temple Grandin</a> described her inability to understand the <a href="social%20communication">social communication</a> of <a href="neurotypical">neurotypicals</a>, or people with normal <a href="neural%20development">neural development</a>, as leaving her feeling "like an anthropologist on Mars".

Unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood. Autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from <a href="social%20norms">social norms</a>; for example, they have less <a href="eye%20contact">eye contact</a> and <a href="turn-taking">turn-taking</a>, and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves, such as pointing at things. Three- to five-year-old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate nonverbally, and take turns with others. However, they do form <a href="Attachment%20%28psychology%29">attachments</a> to their primary caregivers. Most children with autism display moderately less <a href="Attachment%20in%20children%23Secure%20attachment">attachment security</a> than neurotypical children, although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD. Older children and adults with ASD <a href="Face%20perception%23Face%20perception%20in%20individuals%20with%20autism">perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition</a> although this may be partly due to a lower ability to define a person's own emotions.

Children with high-functioning autism suffer from more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non-autistic peers, despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone. Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism. For them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they feel. Functional friendships, such as those resulting in invitations to parties, may affect the quality of life more deeply.

There are many anecdotal reports, but few systematic studies, of aggression and violence in individuals with ASD. The limited data suggest that, in children with intellectual disability, autism is associated with aggression, destruction of property, and <a href="tantrum">tantrums</a>.

About a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs. Differences in communication may be present from the first year of life, and may include delayed onset of <a href="babbling">babbling</a>, unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver. In the second and third years, children with autism have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences, and are more likely to simply repeat others' words (<a href="echolalia">echolalia</a>) or <a href="Pronoun%20reversal">reverse pronouns</a>. <a href="Joint%20attention">Joint attention</a> seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD: for example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object, and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience. Children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.

In a pair of studies, high-functioning children with autism aged 8–15 performed equally well as, and adults better than, individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling. Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language, comprehension and inference. As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills, these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends.

Autistic individuals display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior, which the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R) categorizes as follows.
No single repetitive or self-injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism, but autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors.

Autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis, but that can affect the individual or the family.
An estimated 0.5% to 10% of individuals with ASD show unusual abilities, ranging from <a href="splinter%20skill">splinter skills</a> such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious <a href="Savant%20syndrome">autistic savants</a>. Many individuals with ASD show superior skills in perception and attention, relative to the general population. <a href="Sensory%20system">Sensory</a> abnormalities are found in over 90% of those with autism, and are considered core features by some, although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders. Differences are greater for under-responsivity (for example, walking into things) than for over-responsivity (for example, distress from loud noises) or for sensation seeking (for example, rhythmic movements). An estimated 60%–80% of autistic people have motor signs that include <a href="Hypotonia">poor muscle tone</a>, <a href="Apraxia">poor motor planning</a>, and <a href="toe%20walking">toe walking</a>; deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across ASD and are greater in autism proper.

Unusual eating behavior occurs in about three-quarters of children with ASD, to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator. Selectivity is the most common problem, although eating rituals and food refusal also occur; this does not appear to result in <a href="malnutrition">malnutrition</a>. Although some children with autism also have <a href="gastrointestinal%20symptom">gastrointestinal symptoms</a>, there is a lack of published rigorous data to support the theory that children with autism have more or different gastrointestinal symptoms than usual; studies report conflicting results, and the relationship between gastrointestinal problems and ASD is unclear.

Parents of children with ASD have higher levels of <a href="stress%20%28psychological%29">stress</a>. Siblings of children with ASD report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings of children with <a href="Down%20syndrome">Down syndrome</a> in these aspects of the sibling relationship. However, they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with <a href="Down%20syndrome">Down syndrome</a>; siblings of individuals with ASD have greater risk of negative well-being and poorer sibling relationships as adults.

It has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic, cognitive, and neural levels for autism's characteristic triad of symptoms. However, there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co-occur.
Autism has a strong genetic basis, although the <a href="Heritability%20of%20autism">genetics of autism</a> are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare <a href="mutation">mutations</a> with major effects, or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants. Complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes, the environment, and <a href="epigenetic">epigenetic</a> factors which do not change <a href="DNA">DNA</a> sequencing but are heritable and influence <a href="gene%20expression">gene expression</a>. Many genes have been associated with autism through sequencing the genomes of affected individuals and their parents.

Studies of twins suggest that <a href="heritability">heritability</a> is 0.7 for autism and as high as 0.9 for ASD, and siblings of those with autism are about 25 times more likely to be autistic than the general population. However, most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified. Typically, autism cannot be traced to a <a href="Mendelian">Mendelian</a> (single-gene) mutation or to a single <a href="chromosome%20abnormality">chromosome abnormality</a>, and none of the genetic syndromes associated with ASDs have been shown to selectively cause ASD. Numerous candidate genes have been located, with only small effects attributable to any particular gene. Most loci individually explain less than 1% of cases of autism. The large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family members may result from spontaneous <a href="structural%20variation">structural variation</a> — such as <a href="Deletion%20%28genetics%29">deletions</a>, <a href="Gene%20duplication">duplications</a> or <a href="Chromosomal%20inversion">inversions</a> in genetic material during <a href="meiosis">meiosis</a>. Hence, a substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited: that is, the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome.

Several lines of evidence point to <a href="Synapse">synaptic</a> dysfunction as a cause of autism. Some rare mutations may lead to autism by disrupting some synaptic pathways, such as those involved with <a href="cell%20adhesion">cell adhesion</a>. Gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in synapses and on activity-dependent changes. All known <a href="teratogen">teratogens</a> (agents that cause <a href="birth%20defect">birth defects</a>) related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from <a href="Human%20fertilization">conception</a>, and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later, there is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development.

Exposure to <a href="air%20pollution">air pollution</a> during pregnancy, especially <a href="heavy%20metal%20%28chemistry%29">heavy metals</a> and particulates, may increase the risk of autism. <a href="Environmental%20factor">Environmental factors</a> that have been claimed without evidence to contribute to or exacerbate autism include certain foods, <a href="infectious%20disease">infectious diseases</a>, <a href="solvent">solvents</a>, <a href="diesel%20exhaust">diesel exhaust</a>, <a href="PCBs">PCBs</a>, <a href="phthalates">phthalates</a> and <a href="phenols">phenols</a> used in plastic products, <a href="pesticide">pesticides</a>, <a href="brominated%20flame%20retardant">brominated flame retardants</a>, <a href="Ethanol">alcohol</a>, smoking, <a href="illicit%20drug">illicit drugs</a>, <a href="vaccine">vaccines</a>, and <a href="prenatal%20stress">prenatal stress</a>. No evidence has been found for these claims, and some such as the MMR vaccine have been completely disproven.

Parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination. This has led to unsupported theories blaming <a href="Vaccine%20controversy%23Vaccine%20overload">vaccine "overload"</a>, a <a href="Thiomersal%20controversy">vaccine preservative</a>, or the <a href="MMR%20vaccine%20controversy">MMR vaccine</a> for causing autism. The latter theory was supported by a litigation-funded study that has since been shown to have been "an elaborate fraud". Although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible, parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of <a href="childhood%20immunizations">childhood immunizations</a>, <a href="MMR%20vaccine%20controversy%23Disease%20outbreaks">outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases</a> in some countries, and the preventable deaths of several children.

Autism's symptoms result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain. How autism occurs is not well understood. Its mechanism can be divided into two areas: the <a href="pathophysiology">pathophysiology</a> of brain structures and processes associated with autism, and the <a href="neuropsychological">neuropsychological</a> linkages between brain structures and behaviors. The behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiologies.

Unlike many other brain disorders, such as <a href="Parkinson%27s">Parkinson's</a>, autism does not have a clear unifying mechanism at either the molecular, cellular, or systems level; it is not known whether autism is a few disorders caused by mutations converging on a few common molecular pathways, or is (like intellectual disability) a large set of disorders with diverse mechanisms. Autism appears to result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems, and to disturb the timing of brain development more than the final product. <a href="Neuroanatomical">Neuroanatomical</a> studies and the associations with <a href="teratogens">teratogens</a> strongly suggest that autism's mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception. This anomaly appears to start a cascade of pathological events in the brain that are significantly influenced by environmental factors. Just after birth, the brains of children with autism tend to grow faster than usual, followed by normal or relatively slower growth in childhood. It is not known whether early overgrowth occurs in all children with autism. It seems to be most prominent in brain areas underlying the development of higher cognitive specialization. Hypotheses for the cellular and molecular bases of pathological early overgrowth include the following:

The <a href="immune%20system">immune system</a> is thought to play an important role in autism. Children with autism have been found by researchers to have <a href="inflammation">inflammation</a> of both the peripheral and central immune systems as indicated by increased levels of pro-inflammatory <a href="cytokines">cytokines</a> and significant activation of <a href="microglia">microglia</a>. Biomarkers of abnormal immune function have also been associated with increased impairments in behaviors that are characteristic of the core features of autism such as deficits in social interactions and communication. Interactions between the <a href="immune%20system">immune system</a> and the <a href="nervous%20system">nervous system</a> begin early during the <a href="Human%20embryogenesis">embryonic stage</a> of life, and successful neurodevelopment depends on a balanced immune response. It is thought that activation of a pregnant mother's immune system such as from environmental toxicants or infection can contribute to causing autism through causing a disruption of brain development. This is supported by recent studies that have found that infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of autism.

The relationship of <a href="neurochemical">neurochemicals</a> to autism is not well understood; several have been investigated, with the most evidence for the role of <a href="serotonin">serotonin</a> and of genetic differences in its transport. The role of group I <a href="metabotropic%20glutamate%20receptors">metabotropic glutamate receptors</a> (mGluR) in the pathogenesis of <a href="fragile%20X%20syndrome">fragile X syndrome</a>, the most common identified genetic cause of autism, has led to interest in the possible implications for future autism research into this pathway. Some data suggests neuronal overgrowth potentially related to an increase in several <a href="growth%20hormone">growth hormones</a> or to impaired regulation of <a href="growth%20factor%20receptor">growth factor receptors</a>. Also, some <a href="inborn%20errors%20of%20metabolism">inborn errors of metabolism</a> are associated with autism, but probably account for less than 5% of cases.

The <a href="mirror%20neuron%20system">mirror neuron system</a> (MNS) theory of autism hypothesizes that distortion in the development of the MNS interferes with imitation and leads to autism's core features of social impairment and communication difficulties. The MNS operates when an animal performs an action or observes another animal perform the same action. The MNS may contribute to an individual's understanding of other people by enabling the modeling of their behavior via embodied simulation of their actions, intentions, and emotions. Several studies have tested this hypothesis by demonstrating structural abnormalities in MNS regions of individuals with ASD, delay in the activation in the core circuit for imitation in individuals with Asperger syndrome, and a correlation between reduced MNS activity and severity of the syndrome in children with ASD. However, individuals with autism also have abnormal brain activation in many circuits outside the MNS and the MNS theory does not explain the normal performance of children with autism on imitation tasks that involve a goal or object.
ASD-related patterns of low function and aberrant activation in the brain differ depending on whether the brain is doing social or nonsocial tasks.
In autism there is evidence for reduced functional connectivity of the <a href="default%20network">default network</a>, a large-scale brain network involved in social and emotional processing, with intact connectivity of the <a href="task-positive%20network">task-positive network</a>, used in sustained attention and goal-directed thinking. In people with autism the two networks are not negatively correlated in time, suggesting an imbalance in toggling between the two networks, possibly reflecting a disturbance of <a href="self-referential">self-referential</a> thought.

The underconnectivity theory of autism hypothesizes that autism is marked by underfunctioning high-level neural connections and synchronization, along with an excess of low-level processes. Evidence for this theory has been found in <a href="functional%20neuroimaging">functional neuroimaging</a> studies on autistic individuals and by a <a href="Electroencephalography">brainwave</a> study that suggested that adults with ASD have local overconnectivity in the <a href="Cerebral%20cortex">cortex</a> and weak functional connections between the <a href="frontal%20lobe">frontal lobe</a> and the rest of the cortex. Other evidence suggests the underconnectivity is mainly within each <a href="Cerebral%20hemisphere">hemisphere</a> of the cortex and that autism is a disorder of the <a href="Association%20areas">association cortex</a>.

From studies based on <a href="event-related%20potential">event-related potentials</a>, transient changes to the brain's electrical activity in response to stimuli, there is considerable evidence for differences in autistic individuals with respect to attention, orientation to auditory and visual stimuli, novelty detection, language and face processing, and information storage; several studies have found a preference for nonsocial stimuli. For example, <a href="magnetoencephalography">magnetoencephalography</a> studies have found evidence in children with autism of delayed responses in the brain's processing of auditory signals.

In the genetic area, relations have been found between autism and <a href="schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a> based on duplications and deletions of chromosomes; research showed that schizophrenia and autism are significantly more common in combination with <a href="1q21.1%20deletion%20syndrome">1q21.1 deletion syndrome</a>. Research on autism/schizophrenia relations for chromosome 15 (15q13.3), chromosome 16 (16p13.1) and chromosome 17 (17p12) are inconclusive.

Functional connectivity studies have found both hypo- and hyper-connectivity in brains of people with autism. Hypo-connectivity seems to dominate, especially for interhemispheric and cortico-cortical functional connectivity.

Two major categories of <a href="cognitive">cognitive</a> theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behavior.

The first category focuses on deficits in <a href="social%20cognition">social cognition</a>. <a href="Simon%20Baron-Cohen">Simon Baron-Cohen</a>'s <a href="empathizing%E2%80%93systemizing%20theory">empathizing–systemizing theory</a> postulates that autistic individuals can systemize—that is, they can develop internal rules of operation to handle events inside the brain—but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents. An extension, the extreme male brain theory, hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain, defined psychometrically as individuals in whom systemizing is better than empathizing. These theories are somewhat related to Baron-Cohen's earlier <a href="theory%20of%20mind">theory of mind</a> approach, which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others. The theory of mind hypothesis is supported by the atypical responses of children with autism to the <a href="Sally%E2%80%93Anne%20test">Sally–Anne test</a> for reasoning about others' motivations, and the mirror neuron system theory of autism described in "<a href="%23Pathophysiology">Pathophysiology</a>" maps well to the hypothesis. However, most studies have found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals' ability to understand other people's basic intentions or goals; instead, data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others' viewpoints.

The second category focuses on nonsocial or general processing: the <a href="executive%20functions">executive functions</a> such as <a href="working%20memory">working memory</a>, planning, <a href="Inhibition%20Theory">inhibition</a>. In his review, Kenworthy states that "the claim of <a href="executive%20dysfunction">executive dysfunction</a> as a causal factor in autism is controversial", however, "it is clear that executive dysfunction plays a role in the social and cognitive deficits observed in individuals with autism". Tests of core executive processes such as eye movement tasks indicate improvement from late childhood to adolescence, but performance never reaches typical adult levels. A strength of the theory is predicting stereotyped behavior and narrow interests; two weaknesses are that executive function is hard to measure and that executive function deficits have not been found in young children with autism.

<a href="Weak%20central%20coherence%20theory">Weak central coherence theory</a> hypothesizes that a limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in autism. One strength of this theory is predicting special talents and peaks in performance in autistic people. A related theory—enhanced perceptual functioning—focuses more on the superiority of locally oriented and <a href="perceptual">perceptual</a> operations in autistic individuals. These theories map well from the underconnectivity theory of autism.

Neither category is satisfactory on its own; social cognition theories poorly address autism's rigid and repetitive behaviors, while the nonsocial theories have difficulty explaining social impairment and communication difficulties. A combined theory based on multiple deficits may prove to be more useful.

<a href="Medical%20diagnosis">Diagnosis</a> is based on behavior, not cause or mechanism. Under the <a href="DSM-5">DSM-5</a>, autism is characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction across multiple contexts, as well as restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. These deficits are present in early childhood, typically before age three, and lead to clinically significant functional impairment. Sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity, stereotyped and repetitive use of language or <a href="Idiosyncrasy%23Psychiatry%20and%20psychology">idiosyncratic language</a>, and persistent preoccupation with unusual objects. The disturbance must not be better accounted for by <a href="Rett%20syndrome">Rett syndrome</a>, <a href="intellectual%20disability">intellectual disability</a> or global developmental delay. <a href="ICD-10">ICD-10</a> uses essentially the same definition.

Several diagnostic instruments are available. Two are commonly used in autism research: the <a href="Autism%20Diagnostic%20Interview-Revised">Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised</a> (ADI-R) is a semistructured parent interview, and the <a href="Autism%20Diagnostic%20Observation%20Schedule">Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule</a> (ADOS) uses observation and interaction with the child. The <a href="Childhood%20Autism%20Rating%20Scale">Childhood Autism Rating Scale</a> (CARS) is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children.

A <a href="pediatrician">pediatrician</a> commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child. If warranted, diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from ASD specialists, observing and assessing cognitive, communication, family, and other factors using standardized tools, and taking into account any associated <a href="medical%20conditions">medical conditions</a>. A pediatric <a href="neuropsychologist">neuropsychologist</a> is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills, both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions. A <a href="differential%20diagnosis">differential diagnosis</a> for ASD at this stage might also consider <a href="intellectual%20disability">intellectual disability</a>, <a href="hearing%20impairment">hearing impairment</a>, and a <a href="specific%20language%20impairment">specific language impairment</a> such as <a href="Landau%E2%80%93Kleffner%20syndrome">Landau–Kleffner syndrome</a>. The presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as <a href="Major%20depressive%20disorder">depression</a>.

<a href="Clinical%20genetics">Clinical genetics</a> evaluations are often done once ASD is diagnosed, particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause. Although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated 40% of cases to genetic causes, consensus guidelines in the US and UK are limited to high-resolution chromosome and <a href="fragile%20X">fragile X</a> testing. A <a href="Genotype-first%20approach">genotype-first</a> model of diagnosis has been proposed, which would routinely assess the genome's copy number variations. As new genetic tests are developed several ethical, legal, and social issues will emerge. Commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results, given the complexity of autism's genetics. <a href="Metabolic">Metabolic</a> and <a href="neuroimaging">neuroimaging</a> tests are sometimes helpful, but are not routine.

ASD can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months, although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life: for example, a one-year-old who meets diagnostic criteria for ASD is less likely than a three-year-old to continue to do so a few years later. In the UK the National Autism Plan for Children recommends at most 30 weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment, though few cases are handled that quickly in practice. Although the symptoms of autism and ASD begin early in childhood, they are sometimes missed; years later, adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves, to help their employers make adjustments, or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits.

Underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases, and much of the recent increase in the number of reported ASD cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices. The increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose ASD, resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms. Conversely, the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis. It is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the <a href="visually%20impaired">visually impaired</a>, partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision, and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or <a href="blindism">blindisms</a>.

Autism is one of the five <a href="pervasive%20developmental%20disorder">pervasive developmental disorders</a> (PDD), which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication, and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior. These symptoms do not imply sickness, fragility, or emotional disturbance.

Of the five PDD forms, <a href="Asperger%20syndrome">Asperger syndrome</a> is closest to autism in signs and likely causes; <a href="Rett%20syndrome">Rett syndrome</a> and <a href="childhood%20disintegrative%20disorder">childhood disintegrative disorder</a> share several signs with autism, but may have unrelated causes; <a href="PDD%20not%20otherwise%20specified">PDD not otherwise specified</a> (PDD-NOS; also called "atypical autism") is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder. Unlike with autism, people with Asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in <a href="language%20development">language development</a>. The terminology of autism can be bewildering, with autism, Asperger syndrome and PDD-NOS often called the "autism spectrum disorders" (ASD) or sometimes the "autistic disorders", whereas autism itself is often called "autistic disorder", "childhood autism", or "infantile autism". In this article, "autism" refers to the classic autistic disorder; in clinical practice, though, "autism", "ASD", and "PDD" are often used interchangeably. ASD, in turn, is a subset of the broader autism <a href="phenotype">phenotype</a>, which describes individuals who may not have ASD but do have autistic-like <a href="Trait%20%28biology%29">traits</a>, such as avoiding eye contact.

The manifestations of autism cover a wide <a href="Spectrum%20disorder">spectrum</a>, ranging from individuals with severe impairments—who may be silent, <a href="developmentally%20disabled">developmentally disabled</a>, and locked into hand flapping and rocking—to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches, narrowly focused interests, and verbose, <a href="pedantic">pedantic</a> communication. Because the behavior spectrum is continuous, boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary. Sometimes the syndrome is divided into low-, medium- or <a href="high-functioning%20autism">high-functioning autism</a> (LFA, MFA, and HFA), based on <a href="IQ">IQ</a> thresholds, or on how much support the individual requires in daily life; these subdivisions are not standardized and are controversial. Autism can also be divided into <a href="Syndrome">syndromal</a> and non-syndromal autism; the syndromal autism is associated with severe or profound <a href="intellectual%20disability">intellectual disability</a> or a congenital syndrome with physical symptoms, such as <a href="tuberous%20sclerosis">tuberous sclerosis</a>. Although individuals with Asperger syndrome tend to perform better cognitively than those with autism, the extent of the <a href="Diagnosis%20of%20Asperger%20syndrome%23Differences%20from%20high-functioning%20autism">overlap between Asperger syndrome, HFA, and non-syndromal autism</a> is unclear.

Some studies have reported diagnoses of autism in children due to a loss of language or social skills, as opposed to a failure to make progress, typically from 15 to 30 months of age. The validity of this distinction remains controversial; it is possible that <a href="regressive%20autism">regressive autism</a> is a specific subtype, or that there is a continuum of behaviors between autism with and without regression.

Research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic population and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of <a href="psychiatry">psychiatry</a>, <a href="psychology">psychology</a>, <a href="neurology">neurology</a> and <a href="pediatrics">pediatrics</a>. Newer technologies such as <a href="fMRI">fMRI</a> and <a href="diffusion%20tensor%20imaging">diffusion tensor imaging</a> can help identify biologically relevant <a href="phenotype">phenotypes</a> (observable traits) that can be viewed on <a href="brain%20scan">brain scans</a>, to help further <a href="neurogenetic">neurogenetic</a> studies of autism; one example is lowered activity in the <a href="fusiform%20face%20area">fusiform face area</a> of the brain, which is associated with impaired perception of people versus objects. It has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior.

About half of parents of children with ASD notice their child's unusual behaviors by age 18 months, and about four-fifths notice by age 24 months. According to an article failure to meet any of the following milestones "is an absolute indication to proceed with further evaluations. Delay in referral for such testing may delay early diagnosis and treatment and affect the long-term outcome".

The <a href="United%20States%20Preventative%20Services%20Task%20Force">United States Preventative Services Task Force</a> in 2016 found it was unclear if screening was beneficial or harmful among children in whom there is no concerns. The Japanese practice is to <a href="Screening%20%28medicine%29">screen</a> all children for ASD at 18 and 24 months, using autism-specific formal screening tests. In contrast, in the UK, children whose families or doctors recognize possible signs of autism are screened. It is not known which approach is more effective. Screening tools include the <a href="Modified%20Checklist%20for%20Autism%20in%20Toddlers">Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers</a> (M-CHAT), the Early Screening of Autistic Traits Questionnaire, and the First Year Inventory; initial data on <a href="Modified%20Checklist%20for%20Autism%20in%20Toddlers">M-CHAT</a> and its predecessor, the <a href="Checklist%20for%20Autism%20in%20Toddlers">Checklist for Autism in Toddlers</a> (CHAT), on children aged 18–30 months suggests that it is best used in a clinical setting and that it has low <a href="Sensitivity%20%28tests%29">sensitivity</a> (many false-negatives) but good <a href="Specificity%20%28tests%29">specificity</a> (few false-positives). It may be more accurate to precede these tests with a broadband screener that does not distinguish ASD from other developmental disorders. Screening tools designed for one culture's norms for behaviors like eye contact may be inappropriate for a different culture. Although <a href="genetic%20screening">genetic screening</a> for autism is generally still impractical, it can be considered in some cases, such as children with neurological symptoms and <a href="dysmorphic%20feature">dysmorphic features</a>.

Infection with <a href="rubella">rubella</a> during <a href="pregnancy">pregnancy</a> causes fewer than 1% of cases of autism; <a href="rubella%20vaccine">vaccination against rubella</a> can prevent many of those cases.

The main goals when treating children with autism are to lessen associated deficits and family distress, and to increase quality of life and functional independence. In general, higher IQs are correlated with greater responsiveness to treatment and improved treatment outcomes. No single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child's needs. Families and the educational system are the main resources for treatment. Studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about <a href="efficacy">efficacy</a>, however the development of evidence-based interventions has advanced in recent years. Although many <a href="psychosocial">psychosocial</a> interventions have some positive evidence, suggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no treatment, the methodological quality of <a href="systematic%20review">systematic reviews</a> of these studies has generally been poor, their clinical results are mostly tentative, and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options. Intensive, sustained <a href="special%20education">special education</a> programs and <a href="behavior%20therapy">behavior therapy</a> early in life can help children acquire self-care, social, and job skills, and often improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors; claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated. Available approaches include <a href="applied%20behavior%20analysis">applied behavior analysis</a> (ABA), developmental models, <a href="TEACCH">structured teaching</a>, <a href="speech%20and%20language%20therapy">speech and language therapy</a>, <a href="social%20skills">social skills</a> therapy, and <a href="occupational%20therapy">occupational therapy</a>. Among these approaches, interventions either treat autistic features comprehensively, or focalize treatment on a specific area of deficit. There is some evidence that early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI), an early intervention model based on ABA for 20 to 40 hours a week for multiple years, is an effective treatment for some children with ASD. Two theoretical frameworks outlined for early childhood intervention include applied behavioral analysis (ABA) and developmental social pragmatic models (DSP). One interventional strategy utilizes a parent training model, which teaches parents how to implement various ABA and DSP techniques, allowing for parents to disseminate interventions themselves. Various DSP programs have been developed to explicitly deliver intervention systems through at-home parent implementation. Despite the recent development of parent training models, these interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in numerous studies, being evaluated as a probable efficacious mode of treatment.

Educational interventions can be effective to varying degrees in most children: <a href="Early%20intensive%20behavioral%20intervention">intensive ABA treatment</a> has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing global functioning in preschool children and is well-established for improving intellectual performance of young children. Similarly, teacher-implemented intervention that utilizes an ABA combined with a developmental social pragmatic approach has been found to be a well-established treatment in improving social-communication skills in young children, although there is less evidence in its treatment of global symptoms. Neuropsychological reports are often poorly communicated to educators, resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided. It is not known whether treatment programs for children lead to significant improvements after the children grow up, and the limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results. The appropriateness of including children with varying severity of autism spectrum disorders in the general education population is a subject of current debate among educators and researchers.

Many medications are used to treat ASD symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails. More than half of US children diagnosed with ASD are prescribed <a href="psychoactive%20drug">psychoactive drugs</a> or <a href="anticonvulsant">anticonvulsants</a>, with the most common drug classes being <a href="antidepressant">antidepressants</a>, <a href="stimulant">stimulants</a>, and <a href="antipsychotic">antipsychotics</a>. Antipsychotics, such as <a href="risperidone">risperidone</a> and <a href="aripiprazole">aripiprazole</a>, have been found to be useful for treating irritability, repetitive behavior, and sleeplessness that often occurs with autism, however their side effects must be weighed against their potential benefits, and people with autism may respond atypically. There is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with ASD. No known medication relieves autism's core symptoms of social and communication impairments. Experiments in mice have reversed or reduced some symptoms related to autism by replacing or modulating gene function, suggesting the possibility of targeting therapies to specific rare mutations known to cause autism.

Although many <a href="Alternative%20therapies%20for%20developmental%20and%20learning%20disabilities">alternative therapies and interventions</a> are available, few are supported by scientific studies. Treatment approaches have little empirical support in <a href="Quality%20of%20life">quality-of-life</a> contexts, and many programs focus on success measures that lack predictive validity and real-world relevance. Scientific evidence appears to matter less to service providers than program marketing, training availability, and parent requests. Some alternative treatments may place the child at risk. A 2008 study found that compared to their peers, autistic boys have significantly thinner bones if on <a href="casein-free%20diet">casein-free diets</a>; in 2005, botched <a href="chelation%20therapy">chelation therapy</a> killed a five-year-old child with autism. There has been early research looking at <a href="Hyperbaric%20medicine">hyperbaric treatments</a> in children with autism.

Although popularly used as an <a href="complementary%20and%20alternative%20medicine">alternative treatment</a> for people with autism, there is no good evidence that a <a href="gluten-free%20diet">gluten-free diet</a> is of benefit. In the subset of people who have <a href="non-celiac%20gluten%20sensitivity">gluten sensitivity</a> there is limited evidence that suggests that a gluten free diet may improve some autistic behaviors.

Treatment is expensive; indirect costs are more so. For someone born in 2000, a US study estimated an average lifetime cost of $ (<a href="net%20present%20value">net present value</a> in 2019 dollars, inflation-adjusted from 2003 estimate), with about 10% <a href="medical%20care">medical care</a>, 30% extra education and other care, and 60% lost economic productivity. Publicly supported programs are often inadequate or inappropriate for a given child, and unreimbursed out-of-pocket medical or therapy expenses are associated with likelihood of family financial problems; one 2008 US study found a 14% average loss of annual income in families of children with ASD, and a related study found that ASD is associated with higher probability that <a href="child%20care">child care</a> problems will greatly affect parental employment. US states increasingly require private health insurance to cover autism services, shifting costs from publicly funded education programs to privately funded health insurance. After childhood, key treatment issues include residential care, job training and placement, sexuality, social skills, and <a href="estate%20planning">estate planning</a>.

The emergence of the autism rights movement has served as an attempt to encourage people to be more tolerant of those with autism. Through this movement, people hope to cause others to think of autism as a difference instead of a disease. Proponents of this movement wish to seek “acceptance, not cures.” There have also been many worldwide events promoting autism awareness such as <a href="World%20Autism%20Awareness%20Day">World Autism Awareness Day</a>, <a href="Light%20It%20Up%20Blue">Light It Up Blue</a>, <a href="Autism%20Sunday">Autism Sunday</a>, <a href="Autistic%20Pride%20Day">Autistic Pride Day</a>, <a href="Autreat">Autreat</a>, and others. There have also been many organizations dedicated to increasing the awareness of autism and the effects that autism has on someone’s life. These organizations include <a href="Autism%20Speaks">Autism Speaks</a>, <a href="Autism%20National%20Committee">Autism National Committee</a>, <a href="Autism%20Society%20of%20America">Autism Society of America</a>, and many others. Social-science scholars have had an increased focused on studying those with autism in hopes to learn more about “autism as a culture, transcultural comparisons… and research on social movements.” Media has had an influence on how the public perceives those with autism. "<a href="Rain%20Man">Rain Man</a>", a film that won 4 Oscars including Best Picture, depicts a character with autism who has incredible talents and abilities. While many autistics don't have these special abilities, there are some autistic individuals who have been successful in their fields.

There is no known cure. Children recover occasionally, so that they lose their diagnosis of ASD; this occurs sometimes after intensive treatment and sometimes not. It is not known how often recovery happens; reported rates in unselected samples of children with ASD have ranged from 3% to 25%. Most children with autism acquire language by age five or younger, though a few have developed communication skills in later years. Most children with autism lack <a href="social%20support">social support</a>, meaningful relationships, future employment opportunities or <a href="Self-determination%20theory">self-determination</a>. Although core difficulties tend to persist, symptoms often become less severe with age.

Few high-quality studies address long-term <a href="prognosis">prognosis</a>. Some adults show modest improvement in communication skills, but a few decline; no study has focused on autism after midlife. Acquiring language before age six, having an <a href="IQ">IQ</a> above 50, and having a marketable skill all predict better outcomes; <a href="independent%20living">independent living</a> is unlikely with severe autism. Most people with autism face significant obstacles in transitioning to adulthood.

Most recent <a href="review">reviews</a> tend to estimate a prevalence of 1–2 per 1,000 for autism and close to 6 per 1,000 for ASD, and 11 per 1,000 children in the United States for ASD as of 2008; because of inadequate data, these numbers may underestimate ASD's true rate. Globally, autism affects an estimated 21.7 million people as of 2013, while Asperger syndrome affects a further 31.1 million. In 2012, the <a href="National%20Health%20Service">NHS</a> estimated that the overall prevalence of autism among adults aged 18 years and over in the UK was 1.1%. Rates of <a href="PDD-NOS">PDD-NOS</a>'s has been estimated at 3.7 per 1,000, Asperger syndrome at roughly 0.6 per 1,000, and <a href="childhood%20disintegrative%20disorder">childhood disintegrative disorder</a> at 0.02 per 1,000. CDC's most recent estimate is that 1 out of every 68 children, or 14.7 per 1,000, has an ASD as of 2010.

The number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically in the 1990s and early 2000s. This increase is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices, referral patterns, availability of services, age at diagnosis, and public awareness, though unidentified environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out. The available evidence does not rule out the possibility that autism's true prevalence has increased; a real increase would suggest directing more attention and funding toward changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics.

Boys are at higher risk for ASD than girls. The sex ratio averages 4.3:1 and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment: it may be close to 2:1 with intellectual disability and more than 5.5:1 without. Several theories about the higher prevalence in males have been investigated, but the cause of the difference is unconfirmed; one theory is that females are underdiagnosed.

Although the evidence does not implicate any single pregnancy-related risk factor as a cause of autism, the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent, and with diabetes, bleeding, and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy. The risk is greater with older fathers than with older mothers; two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm, and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism. Most professionals believe that race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism.

Several other conditions are common in children with autism. They include:

A few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named. The "<a href="Table%20Talk%20%28Luther%29">Table Talk</a>" of <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a>, compiled by his notetaker, Mathesius, contains the story of a 12-year-old boy who may have been severely autistic. Luther reportedly thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil, and suggested that he be suffocated, although a later critic has cast doubt on the veracity of this report. The earliest well-documented case of autism is that of Hugh Blair of Borgue, as detailed in a 1747 court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul Blair's marriage to gain Blair's inheritance. The <a href="Wild%20Boy%20of%20Aveyron">Wild Boy of Aveyron</a>, a <a href="feral%20child">feral child</a> caught in 1798, showed several signs of autism; the medical student <a href="Jean%20Marc%20Gaspard%20Itard">Jean Itard</a> treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation.

The <a href="New%20Latin">New Latin</a> word "autismus" (English translation "autism") was coined by the <a href="Swiss">Swiss</a> psychiatrist <a href="Eugen%20Bleuler">Eugen Bleuler</a> in 1910 as he was defining symptoms of <a href="schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a>. He derived it from the Greek word "autós" (αὐτός, meaning "self"), and used it to mean morbid self-admiration, referring to "autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies, against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance".

The word "autism" first took its modern sense in 1938 when <a href="Hans%20Asperger">Hans Asperger</a> of the <a href="Vienna%20General%20Hospital">Vienna University Hospital</a> adopted Bleuler's terminology "autistic psychopaths" in a lecture in German about <a href="child%20psychology">child psychology</a>. Asperger was investigating an ASD now known as <a href="Asperger%20syndrome">Asperger syndrome</a>, though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981. <a href="Leo%20Kanner">Leo Kanner</a> of the <a href="Johns%20Hopkins%20Hospital">Johns Hopkins Hospital</a> first used "autism" in its modern sense in English when he introduced the label "early infantile autism" in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities. Almost all the characteristics described in Kanner's first paper on the subject, notably "autistic aloneness" and "insistence on sameness", are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders. It is not known whether Kanner derived the term independently of Asperger.

Kanner's reuse of "autism" led to decades of confused terminology like "infantile schizophrenia", and child psychiatry's focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant's response to "<a href="refrigerator%20mother">refrigerator mothers</a>". Starting in the late 1960s autism was established as a separate syndrome by demonstrating that it is lifelong, distinguishing it from intellectual disability and schizophrenia and from other developmental disorders, and demonstrating the benefits of involving parents in active programs of therapy. As late as the mid-1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism; now it is thought to be one of the most heritable of all psychiatric conditions. Although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood ASD have deeply affected how we view ASD, parents continue to feel <a href="social%20stigma">social stigma</a> in situations where their child's autistic behavior is perceived negatively by others, and many <a href="primary%20care%20physician">primary care physicians</a> and <a href="medical%20specialist">medical specialists</a> still express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research.

The Internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find so hard to deal with, and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely. <a href="Sociological%20and%20cultural%20aspects%20of%20autism">Sociological and cultural aspects of autism</a> have developed: some in the community seek a cure, while others believe that <a href="Neurodiversity">autism is simply another way of being</a>.
